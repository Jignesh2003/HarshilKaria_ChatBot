## ðŸ“š How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
- **YouTube**: Extracted transcripts from top 10 interviews/podcasts
- **Instagram**: Scraped captions from 30 recent public posts

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and structured all raw text into a JSON format.
- Labeled examples to reflect topics, tone, and themes typical of Harshilâ€™s content.

### 3. **Chatbot Behavior**
- Used **Gemini API** for real-time response generation.
- Model used in LLM is **gemini-2.5-flash**
- Included the JSON knowledge file as context in the prompt to instruct Gemini to:
  > "Act as Harshil Karia. Use the data below to respond authentically in his voice."

### 4. **Frontend UI**
- A simple web-based chat interface with:
  - Input box
  - Dynamic response window
  - Clean styling using basic CSS
