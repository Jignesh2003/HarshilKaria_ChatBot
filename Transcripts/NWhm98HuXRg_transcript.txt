I think the last time we met pre-pandemic you were moving towards minimalism now you've progressed further in that sense is what the many changes which which I've seen you make in your life which is also kind of you're setting the environment right for you to live um with the kind of purpose-driven necessary intention drivenness as you do now how did that external change happen how did you bring yourself to that something in me just said remove all the attachments so that you know then it started then it started saying that you know clothes is the first thing I think clothes actually already happened before that because you know when I left when I left foxy so you have a big fat salary and uh I think at that time when I left I was I would say at my egoistic highest to when I started shebang uh so roughly you are earning five six like a month at the time to go down to twenty thousand bucks at the time so automatically you know you have to change your lifestyle so that was like one uh accelerator but when we said let go of attachments then you know let go of dependencies of other people on your life so I said okay I'm not going to have somebody drive me I don't like driving so I will bike everywhere it's faster it's parking it's yeah it's it's easier to park it's faster it's a nippier uh than aside saying that okay you know if I have to bike everywhere that means I have to sweat less if I have to sweat less I have to really watch what I eat uh so I have to make sure that my food is got you know the exact composition which makes me not sweat so that's what I started doing with that I said okay if I'm you know I've got the same uh it's a friend of mine Mohan willas he says uh he's a monk actually very interesting story of a guy who was peak of his material career and then decided to become a monk but he said one thing which stayed with me is like all I need is my four pairs of clothes to to be able to survive so I said let me try to do that so when I travel can I pack my whole two weeks three weeks into a small cabin luggage uh so if I have to do that then my my closet is going to get less you know less filled in that sense and uh I mean I still I still enjoy the things that make the world amazing I still love that you know I get I I Marvel at a great painting or I will look at a you know I look at your space and say it's it's amazing but the desire to own a space like this is significantly lesser the the desire to enjoy the space in this moment for what it is you know and then maybe request you after this that you know Varun can I just sometimes come and hang out with you here and see this space with you and enjoy the space with you sometimes is is there but it's a transient life and within that transient life how can I enjoy the most of these experiences is is how I'm trying to structure my life at this point in time and I hope it I mean I hope it accelerates in this journey because you know again the thing with life is that you you set yourself out on one thing and then you know there is another Fork down the road but but I enjoy I'm enjoying where I'm at right now I'm at think at uh good uh if I had to pause it's a good place and also like you know like you said as much as you make plans in life life has other plans one of the best lines I've heard because that's so true like this clip make sure you watch the full episode
