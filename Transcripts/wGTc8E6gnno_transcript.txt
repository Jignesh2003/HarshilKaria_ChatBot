What are the red flags in a client? If they only want you to execute the ideas that they have. But you didn't mention if they are annoying marketing mistake. Brands are not making marketing mistakes. The startups make marketing mistakes like credit. Shabbang was the agency that came out with the pun campaign. We had a meeting with the entire workforce of shebang telling them that look we've made a mistake. What is the kind of client that an agency should not go with? Marketing strategic priority are employees replaceable. Tough question. One small mistake on an ad can make things go wrong. Has that ever happened? Talented retain growth. Best workplaces are the ones where you have merit that wins. Your co-founder Akshai Gunani has left Shabbang after 10 years. Emotionally, it didn't impact me as much. Many people say that Shabbang has a toxic work culture. [Music] Hi everyone. Welcome to another episode of Alina Dissects. Today's podcast I've been wanting to do since a year now. So I'm very excited about it. We have with us Hershel Kar. Thank you so much for that. I like that that's my identity. Now I'm going to split this into three sections. I'm going to do a little bit of a master class where I ask you stuff about agency because you've built one of the largest independent agencies in India. So I want to be able to help the people who are looking at coming into this field and are in this field and are struggling. And then we'll move on to shebang and how you built that and leverage super mind and then I have some personal questions for you. Awesome. Yeah, I'm seeing that you're like waiting for my questions. Okay. Uh but first I have to begin with if you had to start shebang all over again today, what would you do differently? I think the word everybody's talking about I would have started an AI first agency workflow modules which need to be bettered using AI and I would pitch that as a solution to brands. Uh because today also what we have to realize is I started in this market I think was our aunt May and those was our aunt May it was a fairly open market. Yes, you had the biggies uh but Denu was not Den Su. So for those of you listening who are not following advertising, there are major holding groups. There is uh WPP, there is Denu, there is Omnicom and IPG which is now merged together but it used to be Omnicom and IPG. And there's Denu, there's Hakuodo which is Japanese and there's Havas Havas six 78 however you slice it. So uh you know there was all of these giants were there but market opening because none of them had specialized digital offering specialized social media offering specialized SEO offering entry but now the other thing which is more challenging in today's market is the market is moving so fast right so a skill gap which is spotted is getting covered so fast but I would still bet on AI or AI first agency. When you say AI first, everybody else is not already applying. Would you give AI service? Would you have AI service in your company? You know, in a way it's exciting because in a way because I'm trying to see marketap. So uh for example one of the things that I see that gets lost in delivering the service is client agency number one. Number two is there's lot of institutional knowledge which is not getting captured. So what do I mean by institutional knowledge company guideline number one. Number two, company reject approve company numbers over the long period of time. uh click uh through rates, open rates, uh view through rates, uh engagement spikes, minutes of the meeting, uh open rates, click rates, basically the performance data across fullfunnel, which is uh top of funnel, influencer spends, um emailer spends data, uh brand guidelines, consumer calls transcripts, rejected posts, approved posts, rejected ads, approved ads, rejected scripts, approved scripts. Okay, I would assume already agency already has the documentation. Okay. So basically if AI can be the second brain of the client agency relationship what AI can do is it can read creative context as well. So one massive solution which I'm working on is that you can take all the ads run by a client. AI can start tagging all those ads on 25 30 different parameters and you can then see which parameters are working to drive hook rate or clickthrough rate or view through rate. So ads may be uh creative optimization you can use AI at scale to do that. So uh that is the other thing and then of course uh to build out an AI brain which actually visually can design like the client's way of thinking okay is also solutions that are coming in place now with Firefly API etc. Um so those are solutions that I would build out. uh so solutions which are allowing brands to be AI first to market in terms of quality of service in terms of uh agility of thinking and responsiveness to consumer and from the standpoint of you know this visual innovation but those are the areas that I would really go then recruitment recruit approve track which is able to screen applicants faster. The other thing which we have built out as AI is um interview AI to candidate interview screening. So some of these experiments maybe building these experiments for clients of using APIs to build out use cases inside the client is what I would really try to focus on. Okay. So you would build these for yourself or would you build these for the clients and for the brands as a service to give to them? Both. Okay. So as a self means I stand for it and to the client means I have that creativity of solutioning for you around it. And one question that's coming into my mind is uh I hear a lot of Sam talk about uh open AI and he says that you should build something that uh open AI will not be able to build on top of it because otherwise it's like you said uh it's moving so fast that it will just then be able open AI will come up with that solution if you decode it what he's basically saying build a more niche use case because open AI will always build so a open AI will always be able to build what you're building uh but what he if If I decode that, what he's basically saying is build something that is a hyper niche that has enough of a market uh which can add technical value but is not so lucrative also that open AI will cannibalize it. That is you know one doubt that people have that if I today I'll create an AI but open AI service everything I do is gone to waste. Yeah. But open AI is taking large bets right. So what OpenAI wants us to do, any of the AIS want us to do is use the API tokens to build on top of that. So anything that you use as API tokens to build on top of that will work. Okay? Or rather anything that you use as OpenAI uh tokens, API tokens to build on top of but is a niche use case and is not a mass market use case which everybody can use. AI open is not necessarily going to take that bet. Understood. uh now coming from the agency point of view we have understood what you would do today but if you're just starting out second I think traditionally this industry has worked on a cost plus pricing model so the first thing you have to do is to serve that client Well, depending on who that client is, firstly, you want to have a client which has a for whom marketing is important. Mhm. Uh and how do you evaluate marketing important isual business plan Auto brands trading business turnover. category. Second is category typical marketing spends best branded players. Again, if there is a marketing competition, then the business will spend on trying to catch up because if you have if if your competition is a better brand, you'll want to have equally a good brand. Okay. So from what I understand, from what you're saying is because benchmarking basis it's how you ask the question this is the category I'm in within this category who are the top five players and typically what kind of marketing spends are they doing if it's a publicly listed company then you will be able to get that through the quarterly transcripts or privately listed company register of companies balance sheets. Okay. Priyclisted companies is a new priority for them. So then they'll say okay international business come I want to give you only but the moment you are able to preempt what the business needs then that's good. Now if it's a privately listed business you may want to study 10 balance sheets and today with AI you have the ability to study 10 balance sheets this fast. So you put four balance sheets in. You ask to analyze against each of the balance sheet to get a good sense of the business. The more you know about the business, the more valuable you become to your potential client. Turnover percent of marketing spendes which is marketallenge. you know whatever internet cost overhead component. So cost of uh running the manpower, cost of the overhead and then the margin that is what you'll add as three components. Okay. And How do you get an entry? See that's now the market is so diversified that it's difficult for me to cut this question in a straightforward way because market now has like let me give you a context. Google is quoting that India is having 300,000 new advertisers every year on Google Adwords. If Google is having 300,000 new advertisers on Google Adwords, that means you have 300,000 new clients coming into the market. Now, of course, you that doesn't mean that all of them are spending lakhs and crores of rupees. So, first you be clear which segment of the market you want to play in. The most crowded segment of the market is a segment I play in right now, which is a segment for the large brands that has a maximum talent that also has a maximum spends by brands. So that is why that is the largest segment. I would say the segment which is the segment of the India growing brands. Would you say startups? People who are startups or people who are large enterprises formalizing their businesses now and making it digital. Making it digital uh or even making it serious about marketing. So like let me give you an example. I love to travel to tier 2 cities to understand where is business going in this country. So outside of Ahmedabad I met this company which is a oil company. They have been making uh sunflower oil for many many years and now they are making uh coldressed extra virgin coconut oil. Okay. So now that's a premiumization that they doing but purely without too much marketing. So now to understand then he will be willing to do that. So I'm saying like that there are many companies who have not built a brand but have grown a very large business. It may not be a 2,000 cr business. It may be 100 cr business, 200 cr. But these are still sizable businesses. So how to walk and handhold with these entrepreneurs on the building of the brand journey is the other fun part. For example, 300,000. Is that possible? Guarantee I see if you can guarantee that you would be running that business. The idea is not to provide a guarantee because as the service provider what you're putting is your brains to say here is my reading of the situation. If we follow this path we are likely to grow. Most of the time somebody who has made a 2,000 cr company he's a very smart person extremely smart person. So that is what I think most of the clients are looking for. Okay. And there are so many different cuts to be honest. So there's a whole D2C wave. So you can be a D2C specialist. Uh today I think one of the areas which is highly ignored is retention marketing. So you can be a retention marketing specialist. Uh you can be SEO specialist. You could be production production agency. Uh you could be a brand development agency. So there are many cuts of marketing now and that is the joy of marketing as well as the complexity of marketing now and we are entering an age of uh surgical expertise. So that is where I think the world is going. I give the same advice. So to people who are starting out now, I would say for example something that you built where you're doing production also. So I think it's important for them to pick one thing that they're going to be very good at expand for examp whether it's production whether it is um SEO whether it is whatever AI maybe or journey highlight and then they are known in that field which option I don't I think 10 years ago that was because that time brands wanted agency better. Correct. Correct. Yeah. Probably the brands being built out of India too are the brands you want to talk to. Okay. If you want to do everything. So let me be even more specific. If you want because see where company wants somebody to do everything is when they themselves don't need a specialization. Okay. Because if I need generalized skills which is general brand building skill and I need a smart agency partner who will be able to handle everything. Those brands are today sitting in tier to India. Okay. They are being built today. So they are yesterday's Britannia. Today's Britannia wants a more structured service wants to work with the most highly skilled players but on the journey like you know if you look at Dr. comptor. So it's I guess based out of Punjab. They are a local player and they want to become a national player. So there they may need a local agency out there who's able to work with them but able to see the long picture with them. H or like this oil company that I spoke about you know so there are so many of these companies which have locally very strong presence. Nabati is another one. So Tamil Nadu based they make biscuits. So when we are talking in the context of biscuit so I'm taking these examples but these all of these players will want agency partner that will see them through till a certain size. So they will want a agency partner which has the ability to be a generalist across. Yeah. And that can adjust and fluctuate according to them because I worked with a a client called Galaxy Rice which is huge in like they're selling in numbers Punjab May, Rajasthan May and Delhi May and all of that and they're huge they sell a lot of rice um karnal company it is high level agency somebody who understands the core of India and understands how to market to them. They wanted somebody like that. Correct. And the and there's ripple in the south that I worked with. They also are like that. Correct. Like we want to understand our market. Bombay agencies may not be able to kind of understand. But then the market understanding. Second is they want flexibility. Flexibility and they they will say you're my trustworthy person. I will build that. Now that allows you to be a generalist and that allows you to build multi-killed of what is yesterday today. the example that you gave like my time when I started I could be a generalist but today if I enter a Bombay market then I have to be a specialist so what I'm doing in my setup is that I'm building multiple areas of specialization and I'm clear which areas of specialization I don't have okay what areas of specialization you don't work in I would say right now the one area within performance marketing for example uh like app downloads towards the area I don't work in. Okay? Because that's a very sharp niche that requires a particular kind of expertise. In production, uh there is a certain skill you need for self-p production of a two crore shoot beyond that. So that area I don't work in. Okay. So there are areas which I know but then I am upfront with my client about that these are the areas I don't work in. the areas which I have consistently strengthened and there are only some certain signs that you can have which is that are you being well awarded in all the industry awards for that particular domain okay um you know are you winning consistent business is your referral score good is your net promoter score good on those services so that's how I track the health of the service okay like what I'm building right now for example which I'm still not very well known for as an example is a brand development service. Okay. So, if I mean I've built some good brands from scratch, but it's not something I'm known for like a what a land would be known for, right? But now we've got an acquisition of addict which is now addict shebang which is based out of Holland. So that they are the masters in branding. So now we are integrating them into our offering to be able to say I can give you that really well. SEO as a service we used to not be great at but actually last two years we have won I think give or take uh we of course had wins at the abbies for SEO cases but we also have uh give or take about 20 different awards on SEO that have come in large mandates that have come in uh growth which has come in over 50% yearonear for four years so you know that you're building a very specialized service similarly with marketing automation and fullfunnel marketing I'm trying to work hard to build all of these various services whether it's marketing automation SEO uh whether it's performance marketing whether it's digital media buying like one area which I don't touch is TV media buying right yet I don't have the you know the ability and capability to do that so while I will do digital media buys I don't touch the TV media buys as much I have a few clients who I do it for but it's not a main stay for me uh similarly performance marketing is a skill set that we have really uh harnessed over the last few years. And then you add on to that the digital creative offering, the mainline creative offering, the social media offering, uh production offering and then you are able to basically put together as much of a holistic offering as possible. Right? When you mean what you mean by uh DVCs and TVC so like placements online that's something that you don't do. Correct. So I'm just simplifying it for my audiences so they understand over the over the years all of us agency founders problem. For example players back then prices were set by those agencies. expenses etc. But because so many agencies have entered the market cutting example for our viewers agency I will do it at 70,000 I'll do it at 50 plus a lot of that has also become faster. uh how is it that somebody can navigate this space and um really ask for what they think is the right price and as a brand also high quality high give you maybe a bad analogy but I'll give it to you nevertheless in a way agency business restaurant business in a way um skill. See ultimately now this is where the analogy stops. But at one level the food business is also one which is facing a lot of competition. Yes. Um at the same time there are various price points one can operate at from a brand's perspective the strength of the brand is the biggest quality that you can invest in. So it will it can certainly become a business differentiator for you and we have seen tons of brands like that. I mean some of the customers that we work with are resilient brands simply because or customer eyes closed ultimately investment at the point of truth customer pick versus competition. Okay, ultimately that's what it comes down to. price determined. Okay. Or is it's a function of the skill that goes into the art that goes into the writing that goes into the thinking that will differentiate whether your brand goes so many miles ahead or whether it stays where it has to. M so actually by paying maybe 15 to 20% even 40% extra than the next best guy you could be getting actually skilled people who are moving things significantly forward. So I think for a brand owner they have to be very careful actually in a market like this it is difficult for them because they have the temptation to reduce on cost but the quality that goes in may get affected. It's the analogy of the restaurant is the quality of the dining experience and uh you know here's the quality of the brand experience how well the brand gets created. Certain brands you just look at them and you're like magic uh and consistency in every aspect. So that is what everybody aderes to or aspires for and as an agency from as a restaurant point of view you have to only keep sharpening your skills. M I think honestly in the last few years there are many agencies that have come in but proactive work [Music] these are standing out I'm not saying it's very easy but what I'm trying to say is I see less effort on proactive work to showcase to the markets and then you can ask for what you deserve. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the same thing. I think you're very correct in this because I'll be likeity Do they have the band? If you go for a better agency at a higher price and same thing for agencies um lower cost because we've seen it for so long right so after 5 years they will be like but like now it's like burnt out I'm not making any money because they tried to save cost so might as well do the good work at the high price if you want to do this in the long run but which disturbs the market I feel like correct you know correct so I made the same observation I think uh in terms of like clients is there I'm understanding I'm saying it in a very easy way etc or of course but uh it's not as I think that's why I say the fundamental is focus on the work. The thing I really love is when I was starting shebang, I flew to Singapore to meet this gentleman Chris Thomas who was then looking after the uh BBDO business for BBDO is a legendary ad agency which does uh award-winning work. And what he showed me is uh so he's looking after the Southeast Asia region, India region, Middle East region, North Africa region. So he has that much territory to look after and everything that they were obsessed about is the quality of the work. On the diary it was written the work the work the work. So it's actually it's all about that. So if the work is on top priority and top focus then things can really sort itself out and then of course there are a lot of reflections that I've had on making sure that the work lives with the systems that build the worksh uh so that's a whole different discussion altogether which I've worked on for close to I would say 2 and a half years to build a scalable system to say how do you then take a 1200 100 people to 5,000 what systems would be required for that uh is also important. So if you want to scale you need system but at the heart of it you need to love the work. That's true. And uh to take it to that scale I feel like there is no road map or something that you can take from another business and do it's like you have to build it and then maybe looking at you once you've built it everybody else can follow. But with leaders like you, I feel like you guys have to set the precedent of how these things are run in larger capacities in a India workforce because in abroad you have those systems and you have these big advertising agencies but India systems processes people you know building is something that is non-existing. So you would personally have to build a system to take it from X to you know Y. So like it's like that range has to be set by all and creativity they get a little lost because we think something that they just overlook. Yeah. And then it's difficult to scale. correct in that. So I think that you've done that really well wherein you're like analytical also while being uh creative. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you balance both the things? I've not been able to balance it. So there have been phases of my life where I've just been extremely analytical and there have been phases where I've just focused on the work. Um I'm now trying to bring that balance. Hopefully it will show in the results in the next few years. I think you also have the hands to be able to help you do that, right? Because one person cannot I think you're more analytical from what I understand. But I feel like actually I'm fundamentally a creative person. I know that fundamentally a creative person but you know to scale a business I feel like sometimes you need more of a analytical mind to take it like up there because creativity obviously is a part but that system processes is more important. Yeah it's an interesting uh observation anecdote. So like I'll zoom back to 2018. Okay, we are in 2025 now. 7 years back. Uh you know typically you do these personality assessments personality assessment shape based personality assessment intuitively figure out Triangle squiggle. Okay. Square. Okay. Or circle. Okay. Triangle oriented. Square relies a lot on emotional relationships to succeed. Okay. to 2018 dominant shapes. So I was very clearly a triangle squiggle. Okay. Triangle squiggle in 2018. Lots of madness. But switch back to 2025. If I was looking at the shape intuitively I am more triangle square analytical observation to more vision oriented bottom line oriented how to get to that job fast but with a analytical approach as opposed to a more hyper creative approach. I think it's good to know from this that people's personalities can change 100%. analytical but over the course of years and with the experiences that you have you can change your shape like into different forms. Uh if you had to tell me according to this analogy where do I fit in? Uh definitely squiggle one part for sure. Um and second part torn between the circle and the triangle because you're also emotionally very aware person to be able to interview a lot of people to speak to them to get to the bottom of them you need to have the emotional intelligence. Um but at the same time you're also very clear about where you're going. So the second one I'm but you can tell me if you choose a circle or a triangle. Uh yeah maybe by the end of the podcast. Okay. Okay. So, we get back to triangle. I think triangle is the one that is more clear on their uh goals and what they want and very um yeah could be. Yeah, possibly. I mean, we all have some variation of all but what's the dominant one? What's the dominant one is what actually drives you. So, okay, probably I would say triangle along with squiggle. Squiggle for sure. That's so squiggle dominant and triangle second is what I would guess. Interesting. Okay, I have to come back to the agency stuff. Um, what is the kind of client that an agency should not go with and not pick? Um, first and foremost where marketing is not a priority for that company. Okay. Because it comes back to that marketriity. Now it could be very possible that the promoter says okay basically second is wafer thin margin 4% 6% on an average in this industry 75 days is the daily sales outstanding I know it's a reality Invoice [Music] already at the end of the month. Actually technically 105 days outstanding butes you're a sitting duck right and this is again something for example. difficult and number one. Number two number one. Second is I feel like too many are coming in your mind. No, I I actually I think brands are not making so many marketing mistakes now. Um I think the startups make marketing mistakes uh like like let's say cred okay to spend that crazy kind of money on advertising when you are running you are punting to build a brand which people will stick on to and you are overrelying on brand to drive your product forward. I think fundamentally there's something wrong with that. I mean actually if you look at it I'm a big believer in that all the elements of the business need to fire together somehow. So there needs to be there needs to be synchronicity around elements of the business. distribution goes very strong. you reach a particular stage on distribution only then you do need marketing right uh because I mean there's a concept of physical availability and mental availability right that if you're available everywhere now in cred's case they could argue that actually technically we are available everywhere because we are on an app store so we need to really increase the net wide to be able to get people on there but then maybe you can actually create that impact in a smaller way test how that's happening and then slowly slowly scale it up I the ability to uh and and then also see if the unit economics are working or no. So I mean there's a whole different discussion on the business itself. I'm a slightly more conservative player in terms of I believe in the slightly more what one may call the quote unquote conservative style of building a business. So I'm not for the entire uh burn and grow model and I don't think it's worked for India. And what about all these uh just startups fund because they have so much budgets do you think they are recklessly spending a lot more on marketing that they should Yes. I've also seen brands performance for example rely but also it's a catch 22 you know so if you break this down sorry to interrupt you there on this performance part because it's linked to this um see performance alone cannot build a brand right uh you have to be able to build a brand through building brand image brand credibility and I think somewhere what some of these companies are not factoring in is the aspect of time so is it's you throw money at the problem to compress ress time which is what effectively they're doing. A good brand would take x many years to build. Some would argue 10 years to build. So you're throwing money at the problem to compress that 10 years to become four years, 3 years effectively. If you just it's sustainable. Probably not. Okay. Probably not. And that is where some of the brands are burning out in the sense that they become shooting stars and then tomorrow you don't know where they are or they don't have uh longer customer lifetime basis. Now I'm generalizing so I I don't want to be uh unnecessarily called out for saying key you're making a general statement. So yes there are certain successes that have showcased uh credible value but by and large time is a factor that I think in the last few years India has forgotten. We're a patient country now we have become a uh you know that we are getting left behind on whatever parameters. But that's a more a broader question about us as uh society, how we view business, you know, what kind of a mad rush we are in, all of those things. I think fundamentally we have a very large market. Yeah. And there is enough space for all different kinds of brands to grow. If we are focusing on differentiated service and I think lot of the businesses that are being built in India today should be built on basic unit economics working and not trying to do throw money at the problem. I agree with you because whether it's people or whether it's brands, I've been seeing the same thing. Again, like you said, it's a more it's a bigger problem because of the environment we are in wherein everything has to be done so quickly. Everything has to be bought so quickly. There's quick commerce now that is disrupting everything with how fast that everything is available. But I really think that it takes time to build those legacy brands if you want or those brands and and people for example it takes years for you to get there and just fastening the process will hamper a lot of the progress. So somebody tells me like 2 years 3 years I don't look at a 2 year 3 year I look at what is it in uh for me for the next 10 years and that I know is going to take time. You cannot fasten the process and be like now today I want say these many followers or I want this much money or I want to build because it won't it the process supposed to take time you know a lot uh I've seen that happen with with brands also when they're just pushing a lot of money but then again it's like the investors are there and then it just goes according to all of those I guess the investors are smarter than us they're doing their jobs so I'll rely on their good judgment but I'm just commenting on what I see yeah I know I think there's some particular that that can scale and become so fast, but it won't apply to everybody by large. Yeah. So, everybody's trying it out, I guess. And also, yeah, but I guess I mean this is another topic. We're going into other direction altogether. But back to agency. Yeah. No, I understand that that could be a biggest uh mistake that uh and I wouldn't have seen it that way that they are spending a lot more. Um okay tell me that when you hire somebody at Shabbang uh what is something that you look at in everybody like that one trait that has to be there. So the big thing that we are looking for a lot more now is uh and I think this is not a new answer but it's basically learnability adaptability and the hunger for growth. If you have learnability, adaptity, hunger for growth we want you in the team and uh particularly at the entry levels. So at the entry levels you want that uh you want people who come with a passionate can do attitude uh and who've demonstrated the ability to go beyond what they are asked to do in their uh education period. So whether that's projects whether that's um you know responsibilities of clubs that they may have undertaken things like that or at higher levels we are only looking for skill. Okay. So think of it as a football analogy that you know how what's your skill on a particular parameter that you're being hired for. So if you're in performance marketing what's your skill there? If you're in marketing automation what's your skill to set up flows so on and so forth. If you're if you're a generalist on production then how strong is your network? What's your skill on turning around a particular shoot that may be requiring a crunch timeline? Um if you're a uh AI person then what's your skill specifically with APIs. So that's more at the mid and higher levels it's skill along with the attitude but at the entry levels it's more attitude who is a kind of person that definitely should not join the agency world. I I think agency world is for a lot of uh different kinds of people because you get a lot of varied exposure uh particularly and within the agency also actually I think if I look back and I see people entering my office I think a lot of them uh get access to the pulse of how business works. They get access to how pulse of how teams can tick together. They get access to how consumers can be spoken to. they get access to how craft and aesthetics come together. So I think it's a very good uh breeding ground for u any kind of person who may want an entrepreneurial career or a large career in management or in branding or in marketing. Uh so you know I think it's good for all of those kind of people basically. Yeah. But what you shouldn't come to is if you're a deeply technical person uh which there are very few of in India. So like for example the one person who thinks when you think of deep tech in India is Angad Darani. Like somebody of his stature extremely scientific extreme depth on uh wanting to solve a scientific problem an agency is not going to do that. But if you want communication to solve a problem, if you want branding to solve a problem, if your approach to solving a problem is through communication brand, if you want to know how to manage things well, the discipline and rigor of meeting targets, That's very good in an agency setup. Okay. I wanted to ask you that if you are building a brand today to up market based brand where I'm the co-founder of archives which is a tote based uh totes that we build. Okay. And I'm very happy with how we built out that brand. The co-founders of that are Gorav Bhya and Pratima Bhya. Gorav used to be the ex head of LBMH in India. And uh Pratima used to do a lot of operations for Nika fashion. Uh we have had that tote loved and revered by uh Priyanka Chopra has been spotted using it. Tara Sutary has been spotted flaunting it. Uh Anna Winto has sworn by it. Uh Sienna Miller has been seen wearing it. who's who international and Indian celebrities basically the aesthetic is so so I mean just fantastic so and and the brand story is also I dream in India so there is I dream in India there is a I dream in Pondicherry there is a I dream in wonderust so the idea of travel as a piece that you can put into your little tote which is the dream of what you experience in that place and you carry it with you day in day out is what archives is about. So it's a very strong brand story. It's a very quirky logo with the monkey that we have and we're very strong Instagram page with the kind of storytelling that we're doing. I think uh there was an article the economic times wrote about the forerunners of the bag players in India and uh the u Indian totes who would lead that charge and they've said archives would be the first to do that. So I mean it's been widely spoken whether it's AD, Vogue, uh Harpers, everybody's spoken very very fondly of it. So I would build it more depending on the category. But for this category, I think he's done a very very good job. Extremely aesthetic, design first principles, design first thinking on the way the product is put together, uh lean operations, darling of the press, loved by celebrities, under the radar, not shouting too much. So that's one brand. And the second brand uh which I've tried to follow the playbook of how I would build a brand is on level supermind. So level supermind is uh we try to focus a lot on the product and we got the Google play app of the year for 2023. Uh so that was a good testament. Uh but again in terms of how we are building that particular brand is to look at uh make it a contentled brand. So last week we had one of our reels hit. It was a good moment for us about 25 million views on a reel. uh we built a podcast platform where we speak to different people in the space of mental health and mental wellness. Uh we've focused a lot on being very very consumer centric around building the product. So uh typically is 50 consumers spoken to every week to take inputs on how to further improve the product. We focused on reviews and ratings a lot. So on Android and uh Apple we are uh very highly rated with the kind of volumes that we have. So I think between these two between aesthetic and between let's call it mathematic. So aesthetic and mathematic these two are bringing the elements well together. So I'm satisfied with the way it's going but and then I'm going to see brand right because you would be the ideal person to start a brand. I would assume would be like my question to you but you have done it already. So and I follow level superminds progress. So that has been a good uh learning uh to do that. Yeah I need to I need to buy one. I don't have one advertising budget H&M. So it was uh H&M's Diwali campaign and it was fantastic film that had a multi-star cast. Uh Manushi Chiller, Isha Talvwar, Jim Sarb, all of them in what was a uh whimsical variation between what is reality and what is your dream. Okay. Uh for Diwali. So brighter than ever was the thematic of H&M that year. And the whole film was written around an elevator that you could enter. Uh and at every floor that you got out, you had a different experience. Uh basically your clothes, what you were wearing and what you saw outside the elevator was reflecting what you were wearing inside. So it was little like a true fashion film. Uh crazy, whimsical, fun. So extremely good on production. Uh that's one of the productions that we did which was our largest production. That was good. Now tell me a certain budget without naming the brand. What is the biggest budget that you have worked on on a campaign? Biggest production budget that I worked on on a campaign is about 5 crores. Okay. Of production. That's the biggest budget that I have worked on. Um I think everybody was talking about the dream 11 budget this time. Probably six times of that. Um, so I haven't had the chance of working on a dream 11 kind of budget, but the largest one that I worked on is in the range of 5 crores and the largest media spend that I would have done annually for a brand would be in the range of 25 to 30 crores. This sounds like an FMCG brand. Yeah. Yeah. That's a lot of um pressure also, right? to handle the the that amount of money for somebody else and running it and making sure that that other person is able to then make money through the money that they are investing through you. Yeah. And I've also noticed that when it comes to performance, one small mistake on an ad can make things go wrong. Yeah. Uh and how has that ever happened? Yeah, it's happened. Tell me an incident without naming the brand. or uh spend you have to give the money back. So you may try few tricks you'll be like okay on the other spend I'll be more efficient and then I'll recover some of that spend but pretty much per month which was again in that startup burn phase. Oh so that company shut down. Okay. Cuz it was not sustainable. If I was the promoter then what I would have done is not spend that much probably spend oneten the amount to increase the rass but they were on a certain but you can tell your client that right you're the partner to the brand yeah but see certain things when you're spending that much you just want an efficient execution partner or efficient execution team because they've gone and sold a particular vision to the investors of how much scale they're going to hit. Okay. So it's baked into the business plan. I have nobody to have a point of view on that for that client and now that's reduced significantly or those teams have gone in-house. Now what do you do in a case where you don't align with the brand values or brand actions that they want to take? Do you then think that it's a interesting question but I'm more on the latter. Okay, I'm of the other opinion. Why should I align myself to that brand or that message or that whatever it is? Of course. Okay. [Music] Yeah. And again, that's a sign of a red flag client. red flag mostly typically middle ground. So normally what are the red flags in a client? Uh red flags in a client are if marketing is not an important priority for them. If they don't necessarily have a budget for marketing, if marketing is not going to be a strategic goal for them to leverage their business, if they want you to work on a wafer thin margin, and if they only want you to execute the ideas that they have, these are five signs of red flags in a client. Right. But you didn't mention if they are annoying. There are some clients who are like marketer I think they graduate or the business forces them to graduate. Okay. Because probably you can hire design people to be your operators to do exactly what you want. Tell me a campaign that you are most proud about this year. I'm very proud of two campaigns that we have released. One is the uh Britannia Cros Prashant. It won the awards. I was at the Goa Fest. Yes. It did well at the Goa Fest. It did well at Curious. Curious. uh and then there's a whole host of award shows it will do at but it really uh elevated the business of the client really. So okay, Cro had a serious uptake in consumption uh after that campaign. back. I've not had liberty to say exactly but serious uptake, serious uptake in awareness, serious uptake in consumption. So very good example of a moment which led to a piece of work like this uh and led to real real tangible sales, right? [Music] for the Robin Hood Army. Yeah, I saw sweet film packaging, good aesthetic. Coke bottle bottle press conference price down I think that was a great idea. I think always typically Let's call them the bosses provoke with the right questions rest of the team who is executing to make it happen in record time. So it's really a teamwork but you'll always have an anchor. Yeah, these are some of the campaigns but campaigns or I I enjoy the work I do. That is very nice. Feall ads for very long have been very good on social media and I love the fact that they replicate the TVC's that we have seen growing up. Yeah. Consistent social media [Music] on the back of course talented growth. Okay, they have to see commercial growth and they have to feel respected. They have to feel extremely fair, fairly treated in the workplace. They have to be inspired, motivated. It's a whole variety of factors. So, but fundamentally they have to see their growth. They have to feel respected. Um they have to have bigger challenges uh which are worthy of their while to chase. Yeah. Also the environment should be creative for creative people to spend their time there or more and more because the best workplaces are the ones where you have merit that wins. So the people who do the best in terms of performance are the ones who see the most growth. Uh typically that's how it always is. But you have to be able to codify that and you have to be able to see that to the tea for every person. So that process of building a organization like that is what I'm spending a lot of my time on also. Okay. I think what you're trying to say is basically you have to equip them. Additionally, measurement for example let's say conversion okay second film Right. Satisfaction score. Client satisfaction score track. Quality of the creative work is one of the parameters to go specifically track. Understanding of the brief, quality of the creative output etc. to to you awards awards conversion press tracking uh performance of the work click through open through view through blended parameters plus client satisfaction or of course ultimately reflecting factors and Second is the uh management capability. So we also track the net promoter score of that particular team. wins, right? I think people are going to find so much value out of this because that is true. That is true. Of course, it's a which is why I started the podcast. I'm like because we didn't have that right when we were starting out in this industry in whatever different fields. So, You know there is the the formula for success is IQ plus EQ plus PQ which is a persistent quotient how persistent you are [Laughter] I have done that persistently how you're succeeding correct correct correct I'm coming to that before that I want to ask you a Marketing budget market influencers are taking a big part a big chunk of it now. But today as we speak AI influencers are how is that going to affect influencer marketing for influencers and content creators number of users on social plus digital together would be 300 million And now it is touching on 800 900 million obviously increase influencers influencers influencing saturation not saturation but now linked to industry growth rate it will grow industry digital spends are growing at 12% influencer will grow at 12% it will not outpace okay what correct correct the rest of the spend is understood so that is the future future of influencers influencies different so we seeing the increase but at some point it will become average out between the influencers of different industries if if you know what I mean like that will eventually happen right now for the fun questions hersel are employees is replaceable. Uh some are not, some are irreplaceable. But you can build a system which is resilient enough if they go. Uh but there's a lot of people who are replaceable because of their skills or personality or what? It's always a combination of both. It's a always a combination of both. Skill, personality, attitude, just the heart that they bring. Okay. Tell me something about the Gen Z mindset that you don't agree with. There's nothing I don't agree with honestly like I feel like I feel like there's been over we are now past that I'm like as an employer do you see a difference you know like I'm not Pulky Sharma so no I meant to say is there a difference in working style between a millennial and a Gen Z I don't think so really I don't think so like and I can say that with confidence now we are in 2025 I think in every workforce you just have a lot more people in the workforce now but in every workforce you'll have a bunch of people who really want to get ahead. You'll have a bunch of people who want to keep it easy and you'll have a bunch of people who don't give a damn. Yep. So you will have all three. Now what percentage are skewed inside your organization? That's your responsibility. But I don't think like I I mean I just feel like I don't I think this whole Jenz is a particular way is is I feel like overwritten about. Okay. I think I would say that I mean maybe at the risk of being cancer by Jenzi, I feel like you're just like the previous generation. You just consume different things and you just you just look different. Look different. Look different. Ah, he's going to look different. I'm playing it safe. No, but like I feel like there is a difference because um Jenz's come with maybe a lot more opinion and a lot more staunch opinion which is very good because they give you that kind of input that millennials maybe in a certain way would not u millennials come with more of a hardworking sustainably long persistent journey that I feel like because Jenzi has a lot of options they don't have and I know I'm kind of generalizing but there is that difference and across if you put in if you yesterday's millennials in today's environment, they would behave the same. I don't think it's a there would be some different traits for them. Yeah. I mean, by and large, the whole population, you put it all together in one mixer, it would turn out exactly the same. So, it's like I feel like it's it's the time that has changed, not the fundamental people that have changed. Also, you have to understand that for us to understand that India is a lot richer than it was in terms of disposable income. M uh so you've gotten used to a certain taste of life and you want to enjoy that taste of life also because you got way more things that you're exposed to you're way more opinionated as a result of that because you're a lot more exposed so you have a sharper point of view you grown up in a content first generation so I think people are always people are always people and the time is different right how do you balance working with a family member because you work with your brother how is that like I'm sure it's not like do you take that home does Has that ever happened where you have taken the work back home because it's part of your family? Yeah, it it can get tricky especially with brothers. It can get tricky. Um especially also if you have like a if you're the older brother or the younger brother in my case I'm the older brother. So uh I'm sure it's sometimes difficult for my younger brother to deal with me. Um and similarly I mean for him as well for me also for me to deal with him on certain things like I can't there's certain things I have to keep my decorum on in terms of how direct I can be. Um so I think sometimes possibly if I had to just be very very precise about it with family there's a strength which is that you you know you're always safe and with family the the other side is that you probably can't be as direct as you would be with would be otherwise necessarily because you have to keep the decorum of the relationship. uh at the same time if there's a genuine desire or an impact to serve the same goal uh then you can achieve that and then there's a I guess you know with family a lot of things are implicit you got to feel it so if you feel safe secure you feel like we're walking towards the same thing then it's all good right okay um another one on that uh your co-founder Akshai Gunani uh has left shebang after 10 years Was that hard on you professionally and also emotionally because it's been a long journey? Emotionally probably not. Um, professionally I think definitely he left a lot of uh strong he had a lot of strong contributions to what we built at Shebang over the years. Uh so I have respect for all the contributions that he had towards the towards the journey of Shebang. Uh so from that professional standpoint those professional achievements will always be respected and and counted upon and uh emotionally it wasn't probably and you know emotionally it wasn't a very it was it didn't impact me as much personally it did not because you kept your personal and emotions separately at work because when you work with somebody for that long I feel like you do get invested in them a little bit personally and emotionally perhaps perhaps so You're right about the fact that you could get invested personally and emotionally into a person. In this particular case, I wasn't as much probably also because I've been through an experience where I have uh you know in my previous agency also worked very closely with co-founders um and then went on to leave to build on another enterprise. So I think my uh makeup is probably such that I always saw myself and and and I was the the captain driving the ship. So I continue with my responsibility. Uh I had certain co-conspirators who were helping me on that journey. I continue to have them. Uh the role changes, the responsibility changes. You have respect for the contributions that were there behind and you're grateful for them and thankful for them. But I I didn't reach a stage where I was emotionally connected, charged in that sense. Do you think that that's important when you're at work wherein you have to keep it separate from having anything to do with them personally? It'll help in situations like this if they move on. Honestly, it depends the kind of person you are and the kind of experiences you had. You asked me when I was uh 20 years old, when I was doing my first agency, we got along like a pack of cards. we would we would have this uh immense sense of uh deep brotherhood to really you know bear your utmost self to your colleagues and your co-founders um and then it then I started seeing that it's becoming more towards I'm also bearing it towards my colleagues and then we're going we're going into a different topic now of boundaries but like you know where the u so like I mean I give an example like we used to have bets where If something didn't happen, my colleague would bet against me that I'd be in boxers the entire day roaming around office versus that. So, it's like a very frat boy culture. Probably a lot of the things that we did back then would leave us canceled today. I've seen that and I've seen the ability to build with a uh longer vision and I think the ability to build with a longer vision to be dispassionate about the I mean, you have to respect the strength of the relationship. You have to be able to connect at a very deeply personal level but also recognize that work is not family. Family is a lot deeper in terms of personal relationship. So I have understood and learned that. So um for me I'm very clear that where the where the depth of my personal relationships go where the extremely deep personal relationships go is outside of the workplace. Uh yes, you may have one or two people in your workplace that you are deeply connected with, but that's at a personal level. That's not at a work level necessarily. It has certain advantages that you can bring into work and certain disadvantages as well. But fundamentally, when you're building the workplace, you're in service of the vision. And my vision at Shebang is very clear. I named to you the six major holding groups which are French, Japanese, American, British and there is no in major global Indian network across the world which is what I am building. Okay. Uh Hershel do you think you are a good leader? I think you have to ask my colleagues. No, I'm asking you. Do you what do you think about it? I think I've improved a lot over the years and I think uh yeah I've improved a lot over the years. I'm I'm happy with my progress. Okay. Um, Hershel Shabbang uh was the agency that came out with the Puna Pande campaign uh about her death, fake death, sorry. And so I wanted to ask you what did you do to curb the situation and how did you work on around it after it happened like what damage control did you have to do after that? Uh that was uh probably a period of a lot of growing up for me in terms of certain skill on managing public relations. I think no doubt and I've apologized for it. it was not in good taste. Uh what I feel a bit of a consolation prize is uh 2024 cervical cancer was among the top three search terms on Google. So it's a bit of a consolation prize but it doesn't take away from the fact that the work wasn't necessarily in good taste. I also reflected a bit on the work which is that actually if we had found a woman called Punam Pande who had actually died of cervical cancer and we had put that out and the real Punam Pandy would have said is that the there is actually somebody called Punam Pande just not me okay and I'm forcing you to take awareness of this issue so if really the fact was a fact then it would have played out better yeah it would have played out a lot more like intelligently I guess uh it was deceitful around death which people didn't appreciate. So what I learned in a nutshell is um I learned that actually if you look at your list of stakeholders h and fortify your stakeholders. What I the first thing I was advised at that time was that fortify the things that are closest to you. So fortify your entire workforce. Mhm. Uh it happened on a Saturday on a sun Saturday of course full day I was at the office Sunday full day I was at the office Monday morning we had a meeting with the entire workforce of shebang telling them that look we've made a mistake this is what has happened this is how it's transpired this is what we are doing and probably you're going to face a lot of shame in dealing with your clients and your family members so here is what has already been done to talk to your clients so on Sunday night I sent personally a message to over 600 different clients saying this has happened. We take responsibility. We request you to please let work go on with your teams as is. They don't know anything about it. And here is what we are doing to make amends. M so what happens is that anybody who's working in this company under my leadership should not face the wroth of a mistake that is caused by a single set of individuals because yes we are one and the impact of we are one is also if one person makes a mistake it's a it's it's on everybody so some people are uncomfortable how do I even discuss this with somebody else so the moment you've taken responsibility there the weight is off their shoulder to apologize so that was one of the first things we did which is the circle closest to you. Your team, your workforce is what you first fortify. So that's the first thing that we did. We did also a whole host of committees on fortifying how this doesn't happen again from the investigation of how that did. We launched an internal investigation on exactly breaking down how this went by and what steps we need to take in the future. So that's part of the team. The second was the clients. So uh certain clients had more concerns. We lost also a few clients post that because it was a it was a public relations nightmare to be associated with uh somebody like us at that time was difficult on some clients as well. We had a client who was in the ethics committee of a large corporate said that I just can't continue to work with you. Uh so it's a loss loss loss of uh significant business. So um the second was to fortify with the clients have open dialogue with the clients uh talk to them about how much they want to investigate into what we are doing and how this came about transparently. That was the second and then the third lesson was that the things that you can't control just don't respond to that. So in the middle of a media storm the only thing you can do is duck stand your ground say that yes I acknowledge there was a mistake stick to that and nothing else. Don't say anything else. H uh there were a whole host of other things that could have broken down which is probably a discussion for another day. We're too raw in it. There were things about um you know potentially uh the person in question saying even more wrong things about us because there were some of those things as well. Uh there was actually one of the one of the things that I was most upset about was uh a damning article on LinkedIn by a gentleman called Mahesh Morti. Um now I used to look up to Mahesh Morti. You know we speaking about mentors. I used to look up to Mahesh Morti. I saw him first in 2006. Uh founder of a company called Pinstorm back in the day one of the pioneers of the digital marketing space. He wrote a damning article saying look you've got actually a client in this space. So you've done this work for a client and you've done it in the garb of a public service campaign but exclient has funded you. Oh it was firstly factually totally incorrect. He's connected a few dots but factually totally incorrect. Uh conjecture labeled as fact. So I called him up. I said, you know, sir, I, you know, I've actually followed your work since 2006 and I'm in a bit of a soup and what you've said, I need your help because it's totally untrue and I just would wish that you pull it down right now. Um, because it's not true. It may maybe good content for your LinkedIn, but uh it's going to do a lot of reputational damage for me and it's going to do a lot of damage for my business. and he turned around and he almost like an investigative journalist he asked me prove to me that this is wrong. So then I knew I was dealing with a person who is more interested in being relevant uh than in really uh perhaps being a a person who is a champion of the industry. Uh I had to face the brunt of that. It was what he wrote about in LinkedIn was in economic times the next day. uh lots of business loss. So uh there were some things I couldn't control him. I couldn't control the press. I couldn't control. Uh to our people I could give them strength and transparency and acknowledgement of the issue. Uh to our clients I could give the same. And um definitely big thanks to all the clients who really supported us through the period. There was lots of clients who said yes this is a one-off. we know this is not what you guys stand for and it's a mistake. Reflect on it and move on. There are lots of those messages and then there were the few where it just didn't align with their values and they pulled out uh and few which got dragged into public controversy and pulled out. So um so yeah it was a difficult period probably the hardest uh public relations crisis if you may that I had to face. Okay. Hershel, you spoke about how you dealt with this situation professionally. I wanted to ask you how you dealt with it personally like how do you come out from something that is so public? You know, I mean there was uh there's a lot of people who wrote on my LinkedIn saying shut up we just don't want you to speak again. Um there was probably within the agency circles um there was a lot of we always knew something like this would happen at Shebang. There was also like oh this is a standard of creativity at Shebang. So there was a lot of pressure with respect to like drowning you out. So I was I was affected by it in the sense that that it was difficult to deal with. uh but I knew that if we just focused on the basic principles that like how do we add more value to the customers, how do we add more process to the workplace and how do we continue to make it a better workplace for people then we will walk out of it. So we that's what I continue to focus on and that's always gives me peace when I focus back on that. M uh so that's how I dealt with it personally to focus on the things that are controllable and that you know will add disproportionate value to the organization journey going forward. So I just focused on that and I think I was okay personally I wasn't so affected to be honest. Oh really? Okay. Because you are able to keep your uh emotions I feel like more in check than other people. I'm a lot older than most people who are entering this industry. So, or even your viewers. So, I guess age has a it does it like plays a factor. Age has a advantage. But on that, do you think that um and maybe I'm saying this with certain kind of a look into your professional life from afar that uh early on because there's so much zest and enthusiasm and so much of like willingness to like we have to do this. Um do you think that maybe um when we're younger we take like a lot of reckless decisions a lot of things that we didn't think through at that time and then that has changed because not only you I've seen that with a lot of other founders who are now at uh in their 30s for example and when you look at what they did in their 20s they would be like we could have done this in a little bit more um in a in a better fashion if you know what I mean like you Um that's something that I think comes with age and I think that that maturity little bit if I could say women have a little bit earlier and men do it a little bit later. We we look at that as a um you know personally we look at it wherein women mature faster but uh I've seen that at the workplace also. Yeah I agree. Do you do you think of your journey like that? Yeah, I was I mean I was giving you the example of uh taking bets and being in boxers all day. So, uh that is that is fun peak reckless. I mean in terms of like not the act in itself but it shows you the mindset. So there's a lot of reckless. I think I've spoken also about how I uh left my first agency with a lot of money on the table u leaving and not getting my full due as a result of that. Quite reckless. Was that the reckless part or the way that you left you said was reckless? Both. So the way I left was also reckless and the fact that I didn't. Uh if today you had to do the same thing, what would you tell your partners? I would say you guys leave. I'm the guy who's running this. That's what you would say. Yeah. But I'll take care of you this way. We can arrive at I we can arrive at a deal which makes sense for you and let me continue to run the place. Hash if you're always in the driving seat. Do you think somebody else could be the in the driving seat and you could ever sit on the other side? I've realized this about myself. I'm a solo founder and I'm building shebang with my brother. So that's uh we have that respect for each other to be able to do it. But I am a I'm a driver's seat person. certain type of people uh take a while to understand how other people function because they come from a higher level of understanding of things for example with you um because you're so keenly observant and so I would say very smart very high IQ what happens in that process is that because you don't think like everybody else which is great which is why you've reached where you are but because you can't think like everybody else it's difficult for you to understand why a certain person would do something because you're not at the same level of understanding. No, I I've never had that problem. No. Okay. Because uh maybe what problem I've had is that I've had a problem of not being able to express what's in my head very clearly and the the clarity not translating through. So in my head I might think it's clear and the other person doesn't think it's clear and the task is not fulfilled as a result. And when I mean a task it would be a three-ear task but the task is not fulfilled. But I feel like so I have tried to work a lot at that by being more coherent by breaking down the problem by slowing down my own thoughts combination of that. So I don't think that's a problem that people have had to deal with. But yeah to some extent maybe in personal relationships maybe that has translated or in professional relationships that has translated. So okay uh Har at the end I want to ask you difficult one for me to ask also but like why do so many people say that sheang has a toxic work culture have you ever heard that? I've heard that. Um so I think in my view and I've studied this because that's exactly what when I said I spent a lot of my time uh solving for a meritocratic workplace. What I observed in reflection is that the workplace grew from a 300 member workplace to a,000 member workplace in the smack in the middle of COVID. It was literally 15 months journey where we grew four times the size in 15 months versus what we had taken from 2015 to 2020. 5 years we were 300 people and then within 6 and 1/2 years we were a,000 people. Uh so we had insane amount of uh addition. Our systems weren't ready to manage that kind of um workforce. We were also in a place where we had a workforce which was virtual. So empathy was naturally reduced and as a result of that um I think we probably while we grew to a thousand members we were probably 200 people more than we needed. So we're also in a difficult business environment because the and a lot of companies did this right like you I mean at a we were at a very micro scopic level but at a at a industry level you had the Googles and the Facebooks who had hired significantly during the period of covid and then realize hey co is over the growth that you're seeing is not necessarily going to be equally to what you saw in this period and now you need to downsize we didn't really downsize we didn't lay anybody off but what we were in the middle of was we were in the middle of an environment which was a difficult business environment where within one year the margin dropped one to one/ird of what it was. Okay. So if hypothetically we were at 18% we were down to 6%. On margin so we were at that wafer thin place where I'm telling founders not to operate. Uh so naturally that's a challenging business environment. to walk out of a challenging business environment, you have to put your head down and you need to make a few changes. You need to make a few hard calls.
