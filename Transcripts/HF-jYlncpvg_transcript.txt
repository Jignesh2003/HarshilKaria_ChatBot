foreign [Music] in it and uh normally I'm the host of the show but this time I'm the host and the guest and I've got another guest so we're going to play it a little bit by the ears so I've got Kajol Veda with me and Kajol is the founder of scribbled social uh she's been in this line of work for the last three years she's been running her Agency for the last three years and she's been honest she's been on stage a total of seven times uh so that's the number of fantastic awards that she's won and she wrote to me on Instagram asking me a bunch of questions we decided to meet and uh then I said you know actually I keep hearing these questions from a lot of people so then Kajol said okay fine I'll put it on my Instagram see if there's anybody else who has questions or other we spoke saying okay let's just put it on Instagram see if there's more questions uh and it's typically related to the starting up Journey uh once you've started up and read zero to one how to go one to ten so those kind of questions so that's what we're going to cover today uh so kajal is very nicely put everything together from a lot of different people I think yes from from actually 160 people oh wow okay yeah but a lot of them had very similar questions so I just kind of collated them into one so it's all uh typically agency Founders or people who are starting agencies and a lot of people are aspiring to start agencies as well got it a lot of people that are currently working at agencies and are looking to start agencies okay so super so that's about I think that's good like it's if 160 people are put it it's a good uh representation of all the kind of questions that can come so hopefully if I get some questions at least for the next one and a half two years I can send this saying this is uh you know why don't you just look at this it has probably everything you need oh it is everything that I know I mean it may not be everything that you need but everything that I know I think we've we've got it covered right we've got aspirational uh Founders asking questions we've got people that are maybe one or two years into running their agencies asking questions and we have someone that's again looked up to you for yours me and about three years in I feel like there are so many questions that I have it feels like at every Point uh while obviously while it's been great the journey has been great but you keep questioning yourself you want to know if you're doing it right or wrong you need a little bit of validation yeah and I don't think there's a better person for me to get it from than you okay thank you that's so nice of you thank you so I think that's that's the purpose of today it's gonna serve I think service validation for a lot of people okay super good so what's the first thing that people wanted to know so the first question is how you deal with hate as an entrepreneur uh about Founders and bosses on social media because I keep saying a lot of questions about like you know I I understand I've had a shitty boss in the past as well yeah but I think there's just this uh this kind of talk around uh you know how all bosses are hateful they you know hacks to kind of get extra leaves and it's just it just it feels a little it feels like a downer sometimes especially when you're struggling to always give your team the best that you can you know I'll say a few things unfiltered because there might be people who are not running agencies also right watching this and uh so I'll break it down into two parts one is you know as a as an agency what you're basically doing is you are if you fundamentally break it down you're trading people's skills right okay so when you are trading people's skills that means somebody has got a skill to design somebody's got a skill to write animate 3D code whatever it's a skill that you're trading at a certain price you're creating an environment for them to work there visible work by themselves or work somewhere else because you it will help them utilize their skills better agree so as an agency founder it's very important to know fundamentally that the important thing that you're trading is human skill and then you're value adding to companies through human skill so when somebody is Downing you uh I would say and I'm a little hard on myself usually so I would say that you if somebody's if you see consistent hate or downy you actually have to question yourself am I doing a good enough job when I am trading from that skill or I I mean when I'm trading that skill I intend to profit from that skill effectively so uh so when the skill that you're looking to trade and I mean I'm sorry if I'm making it very like you know uh black and white black and white or like you know boiling it down to the fundamentals but that is effectively what it is I'm trading a skill and when I'm trading that particular skill if that skill is not happy being aligned with me then that's the thing I have to question myself so the way to deal with it I think is that you actually have to question yourself first right uh and not question saying oh who am I I'm an is that not none of that stuff but like you know just investigate be a little curious of babard why right so then once you're a little curious about why and you know that okay this is the policy that they are not the person is complaining about right um or it may not be your policy it may even be a way you may have spoken to somebody huh because again you're dealing with people you're you know like you may have robbed somebody off the wrong way and then that person is reacting so I think it's either you really investigate on the policy that is leading to it or you investigate on what you may have said to that person which is leading to it got it uh and uh yeah sometimes it just might be like you need to scale up yourself because maybe there's also you know like honestly sometimes fundamentally it's a function of lack of respect also I just don't want to work with you because I don't respect you enough because you're not good enough sometimes it's that so then you go inside and you like remove the better part of you that's why you've taken up this challenge honestly true so I feel like that's the I mean yeah like I don't know disregard yes it is painful yes it is triggering yes it is uh you know yes it is mentally challenging uh but if you're an agency founder and watching this then you've decided to put yourself at the top of your food chain because you think you're better so you get better at dealing with it and there are ways to deal with it which you I mean the whole process of running people is uh really your process of bettering yourself every single day and you have to do that that's very well said you should actually quote that in hacker book or something you write someday okay I will thank you so I have had my priorities set straight since day one uh for me it always goes my team then my clients and then me as a whole or my agency as a whole being a proprietor um is what would you say about that or would you do it any differently or do you do it any differently I would say like you know we have we have a the principles put on these walls so our first principle is clients business wins we win so in that statement is that I fundamentally believe that my team will win if my clients businesses win so I think we have to really be able to you know create it's it's almost like the team and the client's success is moving together yeah because most people work at least with us I believe because they really get to do better work to skill themselves better um and I know that then there is the hey you know the timelines are bad hey the you know the brief is not clear hey the inside is just not there uh you're not giving me the time and I think you know we can go into how to strengthen that uh I think there are ways to strengthen that there are ways to tackle clients uh you know I'm not saying that uh all clients are great the client there are certain people on the client side who are very unreasonable and not very clear necessarily but I think that's you know again the moment we prioritize they are like this and we are like this at the end of the day we have to recognize that we are being hired to be able to deliver big something that they can't deliver that's why they come here right because I mean let's break down the agency business right if you see the agency business what is the agency business and as I said at the start we are you know we are trading human skills now a large company can buy those same human skills themselves they choose to put it to a house because they fundamentally believe that humans in a home put under a roof with culture values skills and you know Excellence of the way they do it I am okay to give you that same money you make your margin on it and run your business so because of the Excellence is why they are coming to us so fundamentally we need to realize that that's why we are existing if we are existing and we are not able to get a clear brief then we need to question how can we get a better brief how can we really always a way to there's always a way to so and also like the thing is this right like I mean if you just take you break it down uh I will always make more effort to a person who makes more effort towards me yeah so and I'm not saying wasted aimless effort now it's about where do I direct that effort so uh if I'm not getting it right then do I put the effort to go to the store and see where the product is placed see how people are buying the products speak to the shopkeeper speak to Consumers and say you know actually I found this I think this is the direction what do you think without going to artworks I think a lot of The Angst especially in agencies is like I made three artworks and then it's going into a fourth round that's where the angst is The Angst is not in uh you know like then they say oh brief change brief change brief change that's a regular thing I hear across the board so I think that is inefficient use of time yeah so it's it's the same time more gainfully used can actually help you upscale can help you understand that market better that product better help you serve the client better so I think for me it's uh I mean long-winded answer but the thing is like I think it's clients business when we win is the best particular reference right it's a circular reference and then like each agency owner will want like that oh for me my people come first my clients come second I think for me it's the same I think that their success is very uh closely linked so to be honest the reason I think so differently is because when I started out I started out with one intern so my mother idea like obviously now we have a team of over 40 people and we have some great clients on board but when we started out I think it was very important to me that I kept my team happy so that that team could keep my clients happier and I was always someone that really believed in and I I teach uh part-time I teach at quite a few places so which places uh at IID okay I taught at Whistling words briefly uh I might teach at I we might have to cut this part out but I meet each other IIM very soon okay so uh because I teach it just became uh really let's say the training bit became very easy for me uh and I wanted to I inherently wanted to train every single person that came on board so even with us I think one of the main one of the things that's most important to me is let's say even if a fresher joins us or we have someone that's maybe 10 15 years into the field that joins us it there's a lot of give and take so number one if you've come with a lot of skills you try you know uh sit the team down and explain them explain to them what it is that you know about the industry and how you think it functions because again going back to the client briefs and you said The Angst lies in uh you know repeated changes I I understand I understand very well that it does not lie in the creativity of a person but also I think if you're not bettering yourself with time uh brief on brief like let's say client a uh in 2020 for example gave you about 10 changes at in 2021 you should aim that with client again with client a with repeated business or with client B you better yourself at asking the right questions uh to you know not get as many changes and maybe brush it down to five changes yeah so I think that's that's very important it's true yeah yeah so at what point did you start saying no as an entrepreneur if you ever did uh I I mean no to let's say business no to uh you know putting a Band-Aid Solution on things and not a long term not thinking of a long-term solution at what point and if you did see this is a very like it's an always you always say no to things that are not within what serves you or what is going to better what you do and uh I don't think this is easy answer to that because today also I'll put Band-Aid Solutions on things you I mean you judge by the situation how important that is true how about with business right uh getting new business and client acquisition essentially so sorry but I say no to clients obviously where I know that uh you know I know that we can't serve them well so when I know there's a client that we can't serve well I say no it could be on a basis of the price that we charge uh to the value that they may receive so typically I will know what kind of a client would suit well to us so then basis that I say no fair enough and uh obviously even with that I think there is uh at what point were you able to say no because I know you started with uh you know you started in this office and you started with a very was a competent team so were you ever was there a point where you did initially where you were like no we're not saying no to business right now yeah I started this business in 2008. okay shebang is in 2014 but you know we had a at a very successful run with foxy  where ice effectively established that company as one of the I mean I was the lead co-founder there and I ran that company uh to basically gather very good clients in phase one so it took me a long time to get my first set of clients right and my first client was Maybelline New York but actually that was my first big client but my first client was a client called Viola Jules Zan Dentistry uh vs International uh you know you had uh radio Bhavan these are names you wouldn't have heard of so these were like uh or uh I'm forgetting one more name there was a video that we had done there was a designer Anna John his t-shirts were printed so that's in the company was doing t-shirt printing brochure Printing and all of that stuff I was also uh percept had a division called perception origin so I was taking outsourced work from percept knowledge and on a brand icicl Lombard and then there was a brand force India F1 uh so I effectively built the initial social media also force India fund but again not as Foxy I built it as percept and then as Lauren Kenneth Sachin Sachi uh I mean before it was in Sachin such as just Lauren Kenneth uh so I didn't say no for a long time and initially yeah there was another Sprint eyewear uh you know his office is in Malad so that was one of the things we used to do I used to take the train from either VT or churchgate because my office was next to Sterling it was close to my college just to go there take the train till our last stop which I think I should go so that time Rose mallard or even maybe later with that one I remember distinctly was uh Sprint was Malad and I had called a few people saying give me an appointment so Malad the next you take another appointment or the appointment till you come back you know uh so you have to keep trying and then somewhere somewhere what happens one and a half two years you're working hard people see that you're working hard people want to also give you a chance actually if you're working hard and if the team is working hard so then they're like okay let's give him a shot and then that's when I got my first big shot with Maybelline New York and when I got my first big shot with Maybelline New York I grabbed it with both hands so it was the first Facebook app effectively by a brand in India you know so I I mean I don't even know if your time you would remember Facebook apps but you know used to do uh things from a Facebook app onto a wall so it was like the first uh like uh you know you had the landing page and then you had to activate the app through the landing page it was the first one built for a brand out of India and uh it was uh yeah it was like the Maybelline Color Sensational lipstick which they still have uh Maybelline Color sensation was just launching that time so we had a uh Campaign which I pitched to them was around uh you know spread cases all over the Internet so you go to the app you select your lip shade and you spread a case to somebody with like a nice message so that blew up that app and my media performance was also very good it was six times better than the incumbent agency so I got my three month contract extended into a one-year contract so I was in another League then automatic reviews I'm in Maybelline have another League immediately after that I got a call from Garnier which is part of the same group saying you know we would love for you to try and launch Garnier men so Garnier men is a brand that I launched uh and uh then came Garnier skin Naturals and then uh you know came a project with L'Oreal Paris and then in the meantime I was trying to chase other brand managers saying just hear me out you know don't give me business just hear me out so uh Garnier men was uh internationally launched by an Indian guy called Arjun Bose who's now uh heading International marketing uh for General Mills across the world so Arjun and I met recently coincidentally and then we were recounting how he was in Paris and launching Garnier men and I was trying to launch it here with the India team uh it's a guy called kaushik subramaniam also who was working on it and anshuman banshu who now heads Garnier is was kaushik's boss on Garnier men so it was uh you know like I mean some of these relationships then they keep building up you know and then you do work and then you there's a joy to doing work together all this you know so the other guy I was chasing at the time was a guy called Amit Singh and uh he used to run a brand called Cadbury bournville which is the dark chocolate fine dark chocolate so that time The Branding campaign by gilby was have you earned it because it was fine dark chocolate you have to earn it so we had a bunch of interesting activities that we did there and uh Amit very recently was globally heading uh the expansion of Costas beverages business across the world uh I don't know what he's up to now I should ask him but uh yeah so then that got me a chance with boneville and then Bonville got another guy sudanshu who's now I think one of the heads in the U.S at Mondelez uh and he also got silk with him so sudhanshu and I worked on silk and Amit went on to Cadbury bournvita where we did a fantastic campaign to bring bqc back on television so the Bon Vita quiz contest which we used to do in school was not on air so we kind of did this whole movement to bring bqc back um yeah so then it just you know it went on and on and then I had like I had femina where we made uh the made by you issue which was awarded globally which was the first crowdsourced issue of a magazine in the world um and then we had fcuk and so there was a lot of brands that then started to come together and a lot of these other brands which were there continued to build uh so then my reputation became that that I would work with large Brands but it wasn't always that way so I was working a lot with small Brands doing brochures doing website yeah there's a there's a great company still existing now groceries which is uh run by pradeep Shah and Karan Shah pradeep Shah is the founder of Crystal and Karan Shah was a school friend of mine but I had to basically design that website from scratch because I didn't have a designer at that time who was competent to do website so I actually I don't have Photoshop skills but I hand designed that website so like yeah I mean it's not like I said No at the start I said yes to everything I tried my best at everything [Music] um and I didn't say no for like five six seven years because I was like okay that's cool and then now I just say no because I just won't be able to give my best there so you know like now the the tuning is a bit better so then when it came to shabang also yes I had to bring in uh Brands and my first brand I always say this you know I had uh two very conservative companies giving me a stamp of trust you had a Sindhi company and a Parsi company they're both known to be conservative finolex Industries and godrej and when you have large conservative companies giving you a stamp of trust then it's like okay in a conservative Market also people are trusting you means you you you're okay so it's a bit like that fair I I actually didn't realize for a very long time how easy it is to just reach out to people uh because I mean scribbled is a pandemic baby uh when I came back after completing my masters in London the plan was I'm gonna start my agency at 30 I've got a few good years to go I'm gonna just keep working at agencies till I figure it out I applied to you and you rejected me but you didn't reject me yeah you you didn't hear back yeah I didn't hear back so I was just kind of waiting and to be fair covert I just hit at the time also and we were I think we were in Feb 2020 if I'm not wrong yeah yeah so you wouldn't have heard back from us because we were just we were busy making sure that we don't have anybody from our team not leaving and that's completely Fair that's exactly what I would have done in this situation as well so complete respect there but the idea was that in fact I used to keep telling my friends in the UK that uh I used to keep going like yeah I'm gonna go back to India apply to a company like shebang and work there I very recently figured out how easy it is to just reach out to people I I think one of those reasons was also because when I reached out to you you were receptive you were like yeah you know what let's do this it's so casual and the first time I met you I was like you know what I'm a little intimidated and you were like no don't worry about it like it's all cool following that like the next I think month following that was just me reaching out to absolutely every single brand that I wanted to work with and I landed up getting in touch with so many people and I never realized how easy it would be to just you know actually reach out and be like hey I've done some good work here and I'd like to continue doing so uh because fortunately every single client that we've got till date has been through Word of Mouth uh and has to be honest been because you know we've managed to build and sustain great relationships with our current clients so my first big client was not big but like okay I shouldn't be saying this but my first semi big client was Suburban Diagnostics when I uh we were like four months in uh and they decided to you know kind of trust us and it's been two years two and a half years and we're still working with them after which I went like oh okay you know if a company that exists in like so many cities in India is willing to trust us maybe we should aim for a little bit higher than this we kept aiming aiming aiming and today when I look back like very recently we were just sitting and it was you know a nice nostalgic evening where some of my whole team members and I was sitting and we were just like okay we've done a lot we need to probably sit and write all of this down we need to sit and document this but with all of this I just realized that I think one thing that we were very very poor at and I think most agencies because they get so caught up in the execution of things that they don't necessarily think that it's they they let's say they do give client acquisition importance but they don't give the number of channels that client acquisition has as much importance so how do you let's say distinguish between uh you know active channels in active channels what works for you what doesn't uh at what what stage do you think what channel works for agencies see I'm not very good at this honestly uh so I'm not the right person to answer this question because I'm not so good at outbound marketing and I think we have been fortunate and lucky that what we folk I can tell you what we focused on we focused on uh brand building where we focused on building our brand and we focused on ensuring that you know the work that we do is visible and seen applied into our words given to journalists we've only focused on that and then there's touchwood like a good inbound pipe uh but where I'm really struggling right now is in a market like the UK where I'm not able to like you know I've written to a lot of people nobody's responded so maybe it's an India thing maybe it's the time that we are in in India uh so I don't know if there's a one size fits all like and right now honestly if I say I'm struggling with like getting leads in the UK so I don't know but for like I think I mean like you're you already answered it where you said that you know reach out to as many people people are receptive the only thing that I would add to this is that uh in a large company if you're reaching out try to reach out to an ambitious younger person and I've said this many times like just try to reach out to an ambitious younger person in the team who has a point to prove so like somebody like you who would have decided to work in a company and wants to really make a mark find that person and there are ways to find that person like in terms of like you know how active they are what they write about uh all of that and then try to partner with them to say that look let's do this one project together which will really make a mark uh kind of like this Maybelline example that I gave off like you know the person I worked with was a there's a girl called ritika rajpal so she was a youngest there and then because she was the youngest there she was the you know the like the most Junior person she she was very fiercely ambitious and so we got along well because she had my back I had her back and then you know like obviously like she had my back also but she was also like making sure like look I'm trusting you you can't screw me over by not delivering so she made sure that she made it very clear to me that she's doing me a favor not favor but like she's you know like I can't screw up but at the same time she was also like hey you know I'm just going to give you a little bit of this input this input better suggestions to get it right because she also wanted to make a mark and then like coincidentally like when I came in and I did my work well she also benefited as a result so like it was a win-win from that perspective employee contracts in India today are somewhere in a gray area yeah how would you react to uh a team member of yours uh and or an XT member of yours working with uh let's say one of your old clients or let's say the client that they worked on with you yeah so this is a very specific one in all the client contracts and we negotiated that we put a clause in the client contract that the team that is working with you uh as contracted by the agency cannot work on your side so you have a a two-year it's called a non-solicitation clause so you put a non-solic station clause in the contract uh and uh that the team that is working for you cannot work on your side but again uh the reason I say they're in a gray area is because most agency Founders just come and tell me yeah there's nothing else no no you can you can do the contract with a client I'm again we let's say you have that clause even I'm not on I'm not only talking about one is Law and one is Spirit okay if you have a large company or any small company and I think you know that's also the fundamental what I believe is like we have a second principle our word is our bond when you've given your word you've written you've signed it you know that this is what you're doing then if you're breaking it fine there's nothing you can do but then honestly you have to answer to your own conscience yeah very true so and then clients who do that they get a bad name in the market nobody wants to work with them I would not work with a client who has a reputation for taking people and I honestly the I also think the reputed companies just don't do that it's just not done they just don't do that I was in fact speaking to Alina Gandhi the other day from social media dissect and she was telling me about how uh you know we were just in general talking about you know employee references and uh just about how certain clients can be and we went like we really should have like a forum somewhere because I feel like clients do at some level communicate to each other which agencies they can and can't work with for several reasons but I feel like us as an industry like I don't know how much communication there is within the industry how we've got each other's backs and that's something that I was very interested in yeah it's maybe a so I think I mean what would be the purpose of that just to understand I think the purpose of it is I'm not saying it's because anyone's got any malicious intentions but um just something as simple as let's say uh so yeah what I was saying is it's obviously not on matters as small as the brief isn't clear uh I think it it's on a larger level like there are a lot of issues that people have had working with certain clients and it's not because the company as a whole there's anything wrong with a company as a whole I think it could just be let's say someone in the top level management that's either routing to let's say higher in-house or uh just let's say there's been some sort of fraudulent matter in terms of finances and I feel like all of these matters they are a lot more common than I think yeah I feel the best way to ask is your pre the previous agency was working and like you said I think you know it's not like it's not there yeah so many of the people in in Industry are connected and our friends so like the I mean all the people who are running the right agencies I'm good friends with all of them so tomorrow if I know that there's a client that you know I mean of course their business is their business my business and my business we're competing for business but we also collaborating and we've got each other's backs now we've made an equation so you know tomorrow if there's something that you need to reach out saying look you used to work with this client sometime back what was the you know what was what was the scenario so I would easily answer to you and it would be like okay you know this is broadly the culture of this company and this is their approach so it's also easy to try to understand you know if you have Intel on which agency they were working with how long was the tenure you asked the client also who was your last agency how long was the tenure what was the problem if you get that you often get the answers that you need to how often do you teach your team something new um but uh yeah early on in the start of shebang there was a lot of like training sessions I would do break it down teach it um now it's more more about less about teaching now it's more about like here is where we need to go with a little bit of nuggets of years how we can do it uh but it's not really hard skill training that I'm doing as much now got it I mean I'll do all this kind of time pass so that you know if people listen they get something out of it I'm glad you're calling this time pass so what's the best way to recognize Talent within your team first thing I feel as little controversial but I think people don't complain too much people who just okay you know like fine this is the job here's how I'm gonna get it done here's where I have a few challenges can you help me do that rather than oh you know this client has this problem this person my team has this problem this has this problem that's bad Talent um so I I recognize what is bad turn one is too much complaining second is unable to get along with other people in the team yeah so uh there was this uh uh this is good interview that uh Kunal had with the founder of nothing and he said pro athletes working in pro athletes is like people at the top of their game and collaborating and winning at the top of the game that's what makes a good uh teammate and that's what also makes a good person that you want to have in your team so people who don't complain too much people who are great at working with other good people I would say that's the other thing the third is really precise uh which means you need to know the specifics so I feel like today now especially in the new world that we're evolving into and kind of coming out of this world of I think that attitude matters and you know like oh it's about mindset you know I think that's now a given now it's about how specific are you so if there is a drop off in a funnel then you know where is exactly the drop-off where I diagnose and then when I go into that so it's more about people who know uh the details and also know how to navigate the details fast so I would say these are the three broad skills uh of course you know they they've got to be generally liked by people so usually people who are liked by people have people wanting to hover around them is a great uh example of somebody who can build a good team likable people always you know good uh so if but I think it's not just like it's got to be a combination of all this you're likable you don't complain you're very specific about the skills and you know it's when you're working with people it's like pro athletes working into athletes so I think these four things are what Define good teams so what does a good Handover look like what are some key points to include in it because I have seen some shitty handovers in the last time teams into other teams teams into other teams into other teams and uh clients to agency I would say teams into other teams and client to agency client to agency have not seen very poor handovers so what we will do is we Link in this podcast we'll link our Handover document yeah yeah so we can just link that and then that could be uh I think that'll answer better than what I will answer here that's fair I think that'll really help true okay this is actually a very interesting question that uh uh that I got and to be honest this is something that most again I've been asked I've been asked this question a lot of times on Instagram I've got people randomly messaging me being like uh asking me the most random questions but this is something that I get the most how do you stop over delivering to clients how do you stop over delivering to clients uh first thing I would say is when you're signing the client you build a scope of work So within the scope of work you will say that these are the five people that will be assigned to your account or these are the 10 people that will be assigned to your account uh this is the amount of time they will spend and this is the amount of deliverables they'll have so your friend Suraj he's leading our business development so that's his main job which is to really at the start of the contract Define who's going to work on the contract what their skills are why they're good at what they do is what we will convince them and then those people can deliver this much is what will be defined at the start of the contract so that will be put into a scope of work saying that you know you'll get like eight posts so you'll get 12 posts and you'll get so many banners you'll get so many adapts so that is agreed on a scope of work and that's copper work is then uh put into a contract and then that's the best way to do it which is that you ring fence it at the start yeah and you're really putting mind to figuring out what should be done and what what goes beyond of course you may deliver 10 to 15 Beyond but then you know when you're you know there's a very good saying which is you can't manage what you don't measure so then you're measuring what you are supposed to deliver and when you're over delivering you're telling the client okay I'm over delivering so it's also then you are going extra out of your way yeah I think that communication with the client is also something that's very important because I have my team coming up to me and being like you know we've done a lot more than we were supposed to I went like number one there was a time and place that had to be highlighted and you did not so yeah with the deliverables yes we always do I mean since since day one with every single client we have so then it's not my question okay no but okay fine so if then I'm just trying to think of like okay I guess but if you have a scope of work it most of the time solves it right like yeah it does if you're if you have a scope of work and then you're measuring the scope of work it solves it yeah but I I think we've we still have faced this problem uh not briefly very briefly yeah but uh I mean if you're doing this solve the problem already already it does but I think there are some especially because like to be honest we like I said right everything is coming through word of mouth so let's say when we delivered well from one client they give us another one but in order to keep this client happy sometimes you have to take that client or maybe 70 the value that you actually want to because you're just like I'm doing it to make this client happy yeah uh and when we did that it didn't let's say turn out very well for the other one huh that we had it went and it's going really well but for client B let's say and this is a hypothetical situation right for client B Because client a is referred as to client B we have to let's say we can't say no a lot even if let's say it goes beyond just a little bit beyond the scope and we don't have the bandwidth to because uh again you're trying to maintain relations that like which I feel like you know that's where we get a little lost you are not there to people please you're there to do a good job which is again I came back to the thing what we started this with is that effectively we are trading human skill and then your responsibilities to that business to deliver better not to manage the emotions alone yes managing emotion the managing relationships are very strong part of it but it's not the only thing right so and I think then also you know everything has a price everything has a cost input uh and then within that cost input also we have to be aware of how much efficiency we can bring to that cost input so I think that I mean there could be tied up relationship but also people don't keep talking to people you know it's like just sit down saying look this is what I've signed up with you for this is what you're going to it's cool I've done it so far I'm not asking you anything but going forward it's going to be this way so this was actually a tricky situation I don't think I should be explaining it on camera but maybe after I'll tell you about it after and I could get your input on it what's the key difference between working with startups uh smes mncs all the different kinds of companies so the you know this is a very interesting time for the agency business in India because you have approximately every year you have approximately three lakh new advertisers coming onto Google so that means you have three lakh potential clients within those three lakh you have about 6 000 of them who are high Spenders so you have 6 000 agencies you know six thousand clients coming into the market every year now out of that if I take market share of a company like shabang we would be having 300 clients so you know we are less than five percent market share so a this is not a one size one you know one uh gorilla can serve everybody kind of Market there a lot of players even six thousand you know good clients in the country and then there's the whole 2 lakh ninety ninety four thousand of you know Spenders but not very large Spenders so there is a market for every kind of service and I don't think that's it's about the difference between startup SME and large I think you have to specialize yourself for a certain kind of clients I think today in my opinion it is difficult to be able to serve a large company and a startup and an SME all in one framework I mean we try to do that but we do different things for different people so I'll give you an example we work with lots of startups where we work with them on brand building and brand development so we work on building the brand we work on building that logo their identity their brand book so we work with a lot of startups on that uh we work with a lot of smes with our Consulting practice and our research practice so we work with a lot of smes to say look you know we will do a great Market scenario for you so we are effectively the marketing strategy partner and this you know the CMO of sorts the CMO for that period when they've hired us for a medium Enterprise and for a large Enterprise we are typically doing digital marketing advertising we're building a TVC or we're building like a CRM actually for the medium company also we're building a CRM we did a really good project for uh you know for an Eye Hospital asgi hospitals they had about 40 Google my business you know they have 40 centers across the country and that 40 Google my business locations across each one getting different leads into 40 different email IDs so you know then the call center executives are opening 40 different email IDs and then you're not able to measure who's efficient who's not efficient so we rolled it up all into a single CRM so you basically have all 40 Google my business coming into the same place is an auto traffic managing to different uh CRM Executives you're able to see who's able to respond fast who's not responding fast you're able to see who's closed most number of queries which areas are more queries coming from all that is manual work so we do that Tech kind of work for medium companies also for large companies like we built the whole world of Hershey's you know on the uh like the the content portal for that so I think it's about like being able to cater your strengths what you can cater to each client at every different Spectrum so like uh yeah I mean another business that we worked with which is a small business uh is a great company out of Puna called Auto log so we basically help them uh really you know as a mix of Consulting and branding because we help them really figure out that they should streamline on they should they had two sources of revenue and we doubled down on one source of revenue for them and for that double down of one source of Revenue it was then linked to a new brand identity which was built and then that was given to their partner Network Etc so I mean it's is that kind of work that we do all like uh there's a great research that we've done right now for uh I would say it's still a startup I mean a well-funded startup but still a startup 82 degrees where uh you know that is the because brand where we've done a lot of research for them on what their consumers are thinking about the product and what are the areas that need specific Improvement so it's a very deep research going on for about 60 days where we've gone in very very deep so we do different pieces of work for different kind of companies and I think you know because uh Instagram and like Instagram is a visual medium so you can put reels and you can put posts so people think that we do that kind of work only but there's a lot of different kind of deep work going on in different places so things about where you can add value so I'm a very strong believer in my uh in the fact that my client servicing team always works they they keep the clients best interest in mind like they have to keep the client happy but my content team will always put the client's audience first yeah so especially when we're trying to explain let's say concepts to clients we we have to kind of explain to them how our team is is essentially broken down also yeah yeah uh which team do you see yourself spending most time with and what do you think the Divide is like what do you think their priorities either the client is it the audience is it research wishing do I spend most time with yeah and the follow-up question um personally I'm a bit more like a planner meets um you know like I I can understand clients business fast and I'm more like a planning person and then I can a good planning person always supposed to give a lift off to a creative idea so that's the role that I see personally myself playing and like you said you know there's different people who have different interests at heart the creative and the design you know the the art and copy teams uh the other teams I actually actually love working with them the most because they their focus is on really elevating the quality of the message so they will ruthlessly fight for that whereas the brand Solutions teams that we have uh more about really understanding the task understanding the client's business Challenge and the the account planning teams are often tying in uh the challenge of the client but also the realities of the market in the consumer so those are the three right now that I see especially with respect to creative delivery then with respect to Tech also it's a you know it's a similar kind of framework because the technology deployment teams are often you know they are really focused on what's the best possible Tech solution what's the lightest code that you can have what's the right server to you so that's the you know that's that's those guys whereas again you'll have the uh you know the the account planning theme there uh or account management team there rather and there's the account planning but the account management team will really focus on what is the specific problem that they're trying to solve within the client organization you'll have less of Market scenario on the tech side because it's not communication you're really about deploying the best and most efficient Tech unless it's a consumer facing portal so there then you'll again look at you know what's the market scenario and competitive benchmarking and things like that so we've got like 10 minutes left I'm gonna ask you a couple of quick questions let this be like a rapid fire super okay so how do you charge a national level client is it a lump sum based on Solutions or is it a retainer uh honestly it depends on the project that you've closed because mostly a national level client if you're a new player will want to test you out so it'll be on a project basis and that project will be like a three month project or I would advise typically take a three month project with a client because in one month it takes time to get to know people yeah so three month project where what you will do is you will put the cost of the people that you're putting on the project plus the overhead fee so they'll give you your cost you'll put your margin on that and you'll you know you'll put that as your fee got it if the clients invited you for a retainer pitch and ask you for a cost over it you know obviously you'll put a retainer how important is it to have a lock-in period when uh signing let's say a long retainer with a client see the industry standard there is nothing called lock-in in this industry it's typically a one-year contract with a one-month exit clause so there's really no lock-in period it's not like you know real estate lease because ultimately it's uh you know like it's your but you're you're working with skills if the client's not satisfied with the skills or you're not satisfied with the client both can leave yeah Fair um how do you define and sorry one more thing is the bigger companies typically or the really really large companies will typically Creator only one-way exit clause which means that only they can exit but you can't yeah which is also okay I feel I mean because if you're working with a very large company you work to oil into their system so they don't want you to leave randomly yeah they're protecting themselves which is okay fine yeah to be honest that does cause the client more harm than it does to you if if you were to exactly which is fair how do you define and calculate the deliverables versus the commercials when you're pitching to someone what do you mean by that uh how much are you going to deliver for how much how do you calculate that okay so you uh when you're scoping your project uh first you will try to get a sense from the client what is it that they've paid so far what is their budget so you'll get a sense of that right so while that's one factor that you're putting second is that you will also basis a pitch that you put you would put a certain level of resources on it so you'll put an account manager you put a planner you'll put a creative you'll put a coder or an animator depending on what the scope is so you'll put all of that scope together and then you will try to understand what is their capacity to deliver as a team together so that will be your uh you know deliverable output so that you need to know what your people can deliver uh one other quick question very like quite in line with this uh for me when I initially started out the first two years were profit profit profit profit profit yeah after that when not like we hit a loss but when it was less profit and more profit again I had to kind of start getting used to uh variable shaking yeah a little bit so how do you deal with that yeah so I have the same issue because uh after seven years my this actually just the financial year that got done I had a big nose dive in my margin uh now I fix that but that's a whole different episode once it's successful of how that was done uh but I feel also what happens is that as you grow as an agency you know there are first set of systems and processes for the first 10 people then for 40 people then 100 people then 500 people then thousand people your processes keep changing right and over time you get better at reducing variability that's the goal uh but I think when you're starting out it is going to happen that you will have three years of good profitability then you'll have a dip why does that dip come because your salary costs will go high yeah why will your salary cost go high because you'll have people who will want to leave and say you give me this otherwise I will leave yeah and you will be like oh I can't but actually you I mean then you will keep them also for one year one and a half years then the good ones will continue to stay with you and some of the ones you've learned to make your business operate at that cost yeah so then your pricing has gone higher because you have better Talent then at that cost of talent you can replace somebody also if you don't wanna if that person who's asked you for the fee is not good enough then you're in an open market then you will replace those people but effectively what that's done to your business is allowed your business to run at that cost level because your cost will rise you will try to increase your pricing or you will reduce your cost so it's a it's a factor that you will do you will either or you will do actually a combination of both you will you know because price is not something that you can always control Market defines the price so you will try to increase your price and you will but if there's a ceiling there then you will try to bring more efficiencies but this bound to be a little bit of that and I think the really good companies like if you see companies like TCS they are very predictable so the Hallmark of a great business is when you're unpredictable right but it takes 7 10 12 years to get into that zone yeah and that too if you're good at it if you're good at it yeah okay this is a long question but we'll need a short answer so what I have seen is when when I was hit with attrition for the very first time it came as a shock to me because I saw it coming it was like a tsunami but I didn't know how how quickly it was going to hit me so uh what I've seen a lot of people do is let's say they start at like a base 30k salary uh they're at company a within six months they feel like they've learned everything they can from company a move to Company B for thirty five thousand within six months again six to eight months they move to company C for forty thousand let's say within the next three years they hit a 60k I don't think you can gain as much expertise as you require as much experience as you require you can't take away enough from a company when you work with them only for six months because you're just just scratching the surface so what happens when you and I feel like this has been happening for a while right this is what I think to a very large extent at least in my opinion power the great resignation how do you uh kind of recognize that this person in 16 000 has basically half the skills but a lot of the market that is asking for that price right now is just they don't have as much experience they don't have as much this is something we cannot control okay honestly what we can control is I always advices to people if you're running a Services business or any kind of business the first hire you should make is human resources so your Human Resources person needs to be really really solid and that means your recruitment will be solid and your exit process and entry process will be solid yeah so you can insulate against all this by having a strong Human Resources team what happens in the market is not in your control now when you ask this other point about the skills of somebody with three years experience demanding the certain price the only way you can do it is have a very very difficult Entrance Test or ability to get in so you have to do two things one is as I said you build a strong brand so and your strong brand will be built on the basis of the brands you manage as well as the work that you do as well as the culture that you have so you focus on that so people want to work for you not because it's an illusion but it's actually good and second is that you make it difficult for people to get in and I'm Shameless about that people complain to me oh your test is too long I was like I'm okay with that because then that helps me figure out the good ones from the not so good ones and we like to make sure that only the good ones are getting in yeah so to be honest just uh for I mean uh just randomly I came across one of your tests on uh LinkedIn and I went like hey maybe I should take this let's see if I pass like about six months ago and I did so that that was great that was a good again Services validation amazing um what do you think the highest sorry what do you think the highest paying service in the digital marketing industry is uh I don't know if there's a particular highest paying service it's uh honestly it depends on the business if the business is an e-commerce business then the highest paying service will be more of this uh CRM means marketing automation means banners means Performance Marketing bunded in to give a return if it's a high awareness brand then it's the creativity and the you know the digital creative service which will pay you a premium um if it's a very uh if like a very large company which just needs to bang out dumb dumb dumb creative like you know one after the other uh boom boom boom you gotta go so that the ability to deliver that engine that will give you a good uh uh you know good premium I don't think there's a particular service which is like oh this pays way better than the others because if there is a service with a much better margin everybody will be providing that and then it'll normalize so I don't think there's any you know like one service so uh if you remember the last time I asked you uh about this as well so hitesh rajwani the founder of social Samosa I landed up meeting him at Goa fest last year and uh I was just getting some advice from him and he was like you have to figure out what your core competency as as an agency is what is that one service that you can you feel like you can provide better than your competitors you bank on that yeah so how do you uh number one figure that out and number two capitalize on it so firstly uh I think you know two people you mentioned hitesh and Alina and people like social Samosa and social media dissect I feel like they're also doing a great service to the industry because of the work that they put together where you know this thing which you're talking about transparency and people seeing work uh it only happens at forums like the ones that they organize so hitesh particularly has been doing so much work for the industry so I think he'd be a better person to answer this um so I'll tell you my perspective and then the how our perspective at shebang is we deliver the whole shebang which is we try to deliver everything uh and then we have two philosophies on that either we deliver everything or we deliver the parts to make you complete that is the client complete um how you can identify what your strength is and I think you know typically if you're starting up then it's often hinging on the founder like what is the founder good at like are you good at Tech are you good at you know are you good at delivering uh campaigns are you good at Performance Marketing so always pick what you are really good at because often you are the you know like you're it's almost like when you're starting up it's like you're the you're the general but you're also in the battlefield and you're fighting got it whereas as you go bigger bigger bigger you're you're the general in the middle of the battlefield and you're kind of saying okay this is where you got to go so it's kind of changes at the start it's often hinged on you and then as you grow you bring in people who are really good at different different things and then you Marshal the troops that way so that's the analogy I feel got it okay and often the what you're good at will come from results on work like for me it came that you know my Facebook ads management was very good because I delivered 6X better than the other guys and I'm good at creative ideation and putting the tech together so that was my good often the market will ratify it for you clients were ratified for you oh you're so much better at this then double down on that okay what what are your thoughts on getting started on a project before the mou is signed I think it's a bad idea I think you you need to get into uh chill discussion or at least you sign a one page mou saying that there is a larger contract in place until then you will give me your purchase order if you don't have ammo you at least have a purchase order from a company which is stating that you will be paid you would be surprised this question was the most common one out of let's say the money so if I try to expand on that if and see mousse can take time okay now I understand where this question is coming from because you signed the client the legal contract will take you know its own sweet time typically like 45 days to 60 days to get a legal contract signed because your lawyer is there they are lawyers there sometimes if you're a solo founder like a small team then you or yourself other lawyer so you also have to remove time for that so it takes its time so what you do is you tell a client that you give me a purchase order a purchase order is an is a confirmation saying that I am making this purchase from you so it's again like a from the client saying that I am going to work with you and I am going to pay you this much amount of money but to be honest having made that mistake myself I would say it's a small it's a fairly small cost uh to just get it done from a lawyer you can have a lawyer that you work with on a freelance basis and to be honest now we have a team but earlier when we did not I realized that when I tried being the lawyer let's just say it didn't turn out very well a couple of times yeah so I realized how important it is to just invest in that like you said it's important to invest in Human Resources this is also something that's that's it's eventually going to help your business legal company secretary you need a combination of that and you know again this is a good point because as the founder your focus I think is on growing the business for sure because I always say this that the answer to most problems is growth so if you want you know you have attrition grow if you have too many people quitting grow if you have not enough clients just do great work and grow so I know it's simple but that's the only way out and you as your founder will spend the maximum time and premium on only that and you know the other thing that you need to do is like you need to be on top of legal ring fence your company so while you're growing as a Founders your responsibility to not make sure that you you know there's nobody encroaching your borders yeah so that's where the legal part the human resources part comes in that you're working on policy and culture so legal bdhr Finance with BD being the number one is the priority I think of the founder agreed agreed at the BD is the team even I work closest to it always have so this was again a question that multiple people asked what would harshel do if he was starting out today if he was starting an agency today in a tier two Town um I would do two things and there is actually one agency that I'm working with uh and I kind of uh I'm guiding them a little bit so I think it's exciting because you have a lot of they called uh they're going to change their name but uh Shivam and Aditya are running this agency uh and they are working uh you know so if you're working on a raipur indoor or any of these places Bhopal there's a lot of activity going on and you have lot of unorganized businesses becoming organized or you have lot of organized businesses now starting to focus on branding so what I would really do is I would really focus on being the marketing strategy partner which is that I would say okay look this is how you can organize your team as you start to organize number one number two this is what your brand should be built on and then stand for so a lot of this you know Define and organize who you are right a b is frame the marketing strategy and the marketing plan and the media plan and then three is then offer the services that would be uh good to be delivered that's what I would really focus on the top line is that there's a lot of unorganized getting organized so within that be the partner that helps organize is the strongest partner I think would be then then there would be you know then you would need Performance Marketing and media planning and creative and all of that which will automatically come if you know how to organize it and also like you know I feel like right now also the that's where it's interesting in India right now because the skills that work in an organized market like Bombay the same skills won't apply when a client is getting into organization mode you know so it's a lot about the Curiosity research observing Market scenario planning the growth it's a lot about that kind of stuff so the skill set is different it's not like hey let me deliver 50 creatives yeah that's true that's why strategy I think uh stands at the Forefront of that yeah okay this is a fun one let's keep it short um I'm rambling a lot fine so this is you're going to be inspiring and talking to an entire generation of agency Founders when you answer this Define work-life balance as an agency founder controversial question but I'm here recording this with you on Saturday I have a whole day of work planned I'm running two companies so uh for me it's not I feel like the things that I do with my work lead me to explore life since you asked me to keep it short this is what I can say like uh if I do just expand a bit on it you know now as I'm expanding shabang to different parts of the world I would not have those opportunities if I wasn't you know if I didn't have this team and I wouldn't have this team if I didn't really over deliver on certain projects I wouldn't be able to over deliver on certain projects if I didn't you know like really focus on building proactive work that people said okay there's some Talent here let's work with this Talent um so I think it's all about stretching yourself a little bit extra at every point in time and then like I think you have to work on yourself 100 you have to work on yourself which means that you know the kind of lifestyle that you have the kind of uh you know the the what you feed your body what you feed your mind is very important and I think also like we spoke at the start right as when you're leading a lot of people you've got to be the best of the lot yeah you have to be able to do that what's your hack though let's say when you reach burnout how do you uh how do you recognize that you're about to reach burnout and prevent it um I'm yeah so there's a good real I've done on uh the level page on that which is a signs of burnout um but it's mostly when you're when you're more irritable when you're more Angry you know that you're Nearing your burnout Zone when your body is extremely tired you just can't get up so then you have to disengage for like one day I'd usually try to sleep it off sleep is always a good way to get over burnout I feel uh personally I spend a lot of time on I spend a lot of time journaling my thoughts every morning I Journal my thoughts I prioritize my thoughts I spend at least good 60 65 minutes with myself every morning just me and paper writing uh then I have a daily meditation practice I make sure that at least two times a month I myself am in therapy uh I am working out every single day I love sweet food but I try to avoid it I make sure that my food is you know like according to Vedic rituals as satwik as possible and uh yeah get a good amount of sleep always feed your mind the right kind of stuff uh I think also with what I'm doing now with the journey on level super mind is I get to meet a lot of really interesting people who talk about the science of the mind and how to further that so that's that's where I that's where it's going uh so I'm really enjoying what I'm doing right now that's really nice I think the antidote to Bernard is to really enjoy what you're doing and uh there's a friend of mine who uh Christopher engman who said this line which is that you kind of try to build a life that you don't need a holiday from so most of us work with this hey I'm trying to work to get a holiday but can my every day be the holiday no I agree I couldn't agree more because I think for the first two years first year I don't think I've I didn't stop working for 365 days yeah but when I finally realized that that wasn't entirely healthy and uh you know I decided to just I decided to overwork till I could take a vacation so I went like oh you know I have a vacation I have like a three day break coming up in the next two months I'm gonna overwork till that point and I know I'm gonna like work excessively for the last two weeks so that when I go up like I come back fresh yeah but now I've kind of started started to realize the uh you know the importance of a good night's sleep the importance of just giving yourself like you said that time in the morning because I realized it was so important for me to just have at least an hour to myself in the morning because that's the only time that my phone is not buzzing and my phone isn't or my brain isn't entirely occupied with thoughts so uh so yeah that's that's very yeah try meditation oh I will now I will and uh what you I also feel like another good recharge is nature so if you're burnt out and you are in nature for three days chances are you'll come out very very refreshed is there an alternative to having an SLA between uh you know a client and an agency what do you mean is there an alternative to having like a service agreement no there is a service agreement so you put the service agreement which has the cost the scope the deliveries the exit clause the indemnities the representatives reps and warranties the non-solic station ideally I would say you know in today's world as you're growing as a business try not to do non-competes because the client will say you don't work with a competitor but you can always tell the client that look I will have a completely separate team working with your competitor if you you know like I mean that's anywhere standard practice you can't have the same people working yeah of course uh a competing category so a service agreement is the best way to do it right now how should you idly charge a client that's looking for Performance Marketing is it going to be again the percentage that you charge on ad spend or on a commission basis so Performance Marketing typically media has been charged on a performance base I mean on a percentage basis typically but sometimes you may have a client who's spending only one lakh rupees a month or like two lakh rupees a month and on that if you charge five percent ten percent seven percent uh that's hardly 20 000 bucks so if the time that you're putting in is worth more than 20 000 bucks you basically work out what that time cost is and then you say you can spend your one lakh or two lakh that's up to you but my fees are 75 000. fair so it's a honestly this whole business is a time-based business it's about how much time you're putting in for the quality that you're delivering and what puts you ahead of the game is how much more efficiency you can bring in that time that you spend that's a fundamental of the business so you can spend on I mean on commission basis but if you have a client spending two crows and you're charging four percent commission you know then that's a good fee but you're gonna put the same amount of time for a client spending 2 lakh it's you know it's not going to work for you so you can always put a fixed tree there and uh normally then you can also put a fixed fee plus a variable on like you know your OS targets hit Etc so when I started scribbled in uh 2020 in the June of 2020 I started with no agency background I started with a couple of marketing jobs in the bag but I was working with a brand so again I knew what it was like to work with an agency not at one uh and uh again what I thought was really you know difficult when I started is number one I had no connections number two I didn't know where to hire from or how to hire while I knew how to perform each and every one of these services I didn't exactly know what let's say what it would come down to I didn't know the factors that it would come down to when when the client was making a decision between me and another agency uh and obviously we used to work at really low price points then but what I did realize that it it did most times come down to price the price that I was able to offer versus the price that they were able to offer yeah at the time I also had a lot of time to offer today if you were to ask me it's really difficult uh to let's say even Saturday morning the reason I was saying let's start early is because the entire day post this is like perpetually just going to be packed if you're an agency founder there's no I I don't think you can really distinguish between weekdays weekends when there is important work coming in see at least I feel the people listening to you they'll have some empathy before bashing next time yeah yes but uh all of us my team has been nothing but amazing I don't I doubt anyone I hope no one on my team has said that but they are amazing they've been so nice my team is my pride but anyway coming back to the question uh how do you start in today's competitive environment yeah I think because pricing is something that people use okay so I would just break this down again uh you know we often tend to get a little caught up in this whole somebody's undercutting me you know the there is too much competition fine first let's acknowledge there's too much competition I also acknowledge that I may not be the right qualified person to answer this because I started when the competition was very very less I was in the first maybe 50 agencies of the country uh in a city or like Bombay probably the first 25. so I took the early advantage on doing that so I think there itself is an answer you take the early advantage on what people are spending on so you know there are two three ways to tackle this one is if you follow the fund flow on a platform like Angel list or something where money is going which categories money is going into so let's say quick Commerce is a category money is going into and you're watching that on Angel list you're gonna see where money is going into International markets often the money flows in India in the same way so if you are seeing that money is flowing in this market you start to prepare a specialization in this market that's one way I would start be very very clear that look money is Flowing here I'm going to be a specialist here because if you see money flow here four months previously in the US chances are four months later and India is going to follow the same way very true so that's one way I would do it be a specialist in a niche where a lot of money is flowing and effectively that's what I did because I I put my focus in social media where a lot of money was flowing so that's one uh so here now it may not be social media as a medium but a category so I would put lot of disproportionate effort on a particular category and the second thing is that if you are in a particular category you make sure that you are significantly better than the others the thing we often forget about marketing is that marketing is actually a growth driving investment it's not a price cutting investment okay so if you if you have that mindset that I will cut pricing then you are doing marketing or disservice not just yourself because why companies invest in marketing they don't need to invest in marketing you can always say I will undercut price you know I mean if I'm selling a chocolate bar I can say you know cadburys military and I can sell for seven and a half rupees but at the grocer will you buy a Britannia biscuit or will you buy an unknown brand because Britannia stands for trust Britannia stands for Quality Britannia stands for all of these other wonderful things which is why you're then investing in that particular brand effectively a brand is a device to save the consumer's time so if you can make sure that you are able to convince that particular company that what I will do will build the brand then the person who's buying from you I mean think about yourself as a buyer right like if you're gonna buy a like if I'm going to buy Lunas chapels or if I'm going to buy Bata I will trust Luna because I know it has a reputation for standing for what I stand for number one number two is that it is much more durable it's communicated that to me it is meant for walking trails hiking that's the life I want to live so you have to understand your client also what is the business your client is in why they're trying to build the brand if you figure that out and you figure that you're resonating at the same frequency in terms of their mindset they will want to hire you over the other guy for sure I agree because I think it really comes down to what you're presenting to them the ideas and the creativity and the execution that you're presenting to them when you pitch to them right and that's something for again this is for a lot of people starting out what really I had to learn on the job when I initially started learning that I was like okay let's say if the price point is going to be something that's a matter of discussion or a point of let's say consideration then I need to number one make sure that my pitch is great after that I realized that it's also very important that while your pitch is amazing the way your BD team hands it over to uh let's say the team that's going to be taking over that's also really important so I think it was a step-by-step process when I learned yeah and what I what I found I think over time is that today let's say even if people have limited budgets they will definitely want to invest in in good ideas number two interest if they trust you if they trust your ideas and if you can actually show them proof I think it's very uh underrated like today when I speak to a client let's say Obviously barring the ndas I don't speak about any of that but uh I do land up telling them a lot about what I have been or how I have been able to perform or how we as a team have been able to perform for other clients yeah so gaining that trust I think one after the other is very important yeah and you know the other I think one of the other question was how do you pitch to a client without a portfolio yeah so and I think in fact so while you see the market being more competitive the other advantage of the market today is a lot more mature also and there are a lot more opportunities for you to create proactive work very true so I feel today you know the fact that you've got over I mean give or take at least 15 lakh high quality influencers in the market today is an opportunity so you can partner with influencers and create very visible proactive work that everybody is going to see so if you have a very strong creative idea and then you called up augustyasha and said Augusta I have this idea you know can we work together on this idea and you pitch him the idea and then that idea sees the light of day uh and then a client would have obviously seen that idea already come to life so that's your portfolio basically today so I feel like uh there are a lot of opportunities to be able to build your own portfolio today because a market is more mature and yes while competition is good I think it's a balance when you have more competition you also have more opportunities there is more competition because the market is that big you know there are different challenges at different times so you know the this Market has seen stages of maturity we are seeing now we are talking about CRM we are talking about you know like really deep Tech going into we are talking about companies that were traditionally advertising digital agencies now building Tech products for clients so I think it's a very interesting uh world that we're sitting in and uh you know and so obviously going to get more and more complex and it's about how you can be at the top of your game so that's the that's the bit of it but I hope it was useful thanks for putting so much together I also think just to sorry add to that once again uh like you said recognizing the industry is important right when we started out I realized that in 2020 the need is the hour of what people cared about are the industries that helped me survive the most yeah uh like to be honest Healthcare was something that we we started like I started my research about Healthcare before I started my agency Financial because Financial education at the time was booming and number two education in terms of edtech like and upskilling and those are the areas where money was going exactly and that's exactly if you follow the funding patterns beforehand you can get a one-up very true very true and to be honest I don't think it's ever too late even if you feel like you're in the you know kind of in the whirlpool it's very easy to get into the mix you just have to know the right spots to hit and it's about how many people you can get in touch with then it then it's more quantity I'm not saying you compromise yeah exactly then with the influencer can you build a great a tech based campaign exactly or you know if you're in healthcare can you work with a healthcare influence and do something really cool like uh we are doing something now uh with one of the influencers where we're doing a campaign around uh you know public littering so it's it's going to be an interesting how we did one with Mumbai police for uh dashara where we had a 10 headed ravan riding a bike across the city and you're like uh you know the ravan is asking the guy who's not wearing the helmet so that again and we convinced Mumbai police to to put that out yeah so it's not like I have some extra connections or something I know the commissioner none of that stuff we just went through the local police station picture to the local police station local police station then said go to this in the central office central office said Pitch to this guy this guy said come and Pitch with me to my boss so it's the you know I mean it's it's like wherever you are I don't think I mean I think connections are overrated to be honest in today's world at least is easy to connect with anybody today for sure so that's where it is I hope this is useful to the people watching and I think thanks for all your perspectives in the middle of it because it's good because you're adding both the perspectives yeah and uh thanks for putting this together thanks thanks harshil thank you [Music]
