I’ve really enjoyed turning the @schbang first floor office in Mumbai into a secret gig venue that dances with devotion every other Sunday. Thanks @kirtanmumbai for the opportunities. This even featured the amazing @om.dhumatkar 
P.S. if you work at Schbang and you’d like to experience this vibe, DM me to get on to the guest list.

Proud to share our collaboration with @simpolotilesandbathware and @thegreatergoodfoundation, working together to bring quality education to @turtukvalleyschool (Under the aegis of Afac Trust, Mumbai) in Ladakh.
We conduct a special ASER test here, as varying access to education means children are at different learning levels. This helps us accurately assess each child and support their growth effectively.
A heartfelt thank you to @agharadeep3 for making this possible!

I asked Harshil Karia which campaign he’s most proud of, and without missing a beat, he said the Britannia Prashant Campaign.
What started as a moment marketing win quickly turned into something much bigger. It didn’t just go viral, it drove real impact. Tangible sales. In-store buzz. Brand recall. A meme that turned into a movement.
It’s a rare case where creativity, timing, and business results all lined up, and a reminder that good marketing doesn’t just entertain, it moves product.

I'm writing this for my friend Ranveer Allahbadia...
Life is challenging and it can test you. Ranveer has learnt that recently. One controversy, and years of value someone brought and hard work someone put in, can wither away. I’ve also been advised not to be associated with him by lots of people I respect. That's how hard some of this can be. But a friendship is a friendship. And the lens through which I’ve seen him remains deeply valued and respected.
Ranveer has long been admired by the masses of India. People inherently love him for who he is. And along with the love he manages to generate, I admire his discipline, consistency, and how deeply he cares about what he puts out into the world.
I want to share about three pieces of content I loved that helped me appreciate him better and learn from his work.
First is his latest documentary on hair. A powerful mix of vulnerability and research. One of the best pieces I’ve seen on the subject. It’s classic Ranveer in a new avatar that people have loved, and people have always loved him for adding value to their lives. He does it in a great way here.
Second is his ‘Taakat’ episode with Suresh Raina. It reinvented the podcast format. Not the same static setup. It felt like you were in the room with them. It shows how well he understands film and camera.
Third is his piece on the platinum button. The way it was shot and delivered was exceptional. The kind of content that reminds you why you started.
People have said rude things. Doubted him. Scrutinized his every word.
Through all the noise, he’s kept creating. Kept showing up.
He’s doing some of the best work I’ve seen. I respect him for that. And I love him like a brother. 
Kudos to @ranveerallahbadia, the team, and the co-founder of beerbiceps @join2manish and @nachiket.nisal the man managing the Rocket.

Imagine being the first in your family to ever hold a book, to dream beyond the fields, to see a world no one ever told you existed.
That’s what Vidyavaan is doing—one child at a time.
Across 18 villages and 22 learning centers in Palghar, we reach 495+ children every single day. 
Many of them come from families where education has never been a priority—not because they don’t care, but because survival always came first.
But we’re breaking the cycle.
For 2 hours a day, 6 days a week, these children step into a world of learning—developing life skills and study skills that shape their future.
But we know a hungry mind can’t focus.
So before or after every class, we provide them with a meal or snack—ensuring no child learns on an empty stomach.
And the most heartwarming part? The teachers aren’t outsiders—they’re from their own villages. People they trust, guiding them towards a future they never thought possible.
Vidyavaan is more than just education. It’s a revolution of hope.
It’s about breaking barriers, building futures, and rewriting destinies.
But there’s still a long way to go.
Many children still drop out. Many still don’t see the power of learning.
And that’s where YOU come in.
- If this inspires you, share it. Let’s make education a priority for every child.
- Tag someone who believes in this cause.
- Want to help? Join us in making a difference.

Because when a child learns, a future brightens. And that’s a future worth fighting for. 💙

At the heart of the @thegreatergoodfoundation lies a powerful vision, not just to serve the community, but to unite as an industry and contribute meaningfully towards the greater good of society.
Over the past year, our efforts have been strategically focused on building strong foundational skills among children, improving literacy and numeracy through our pre- and post-school programs.
But we didn’t stop there.
We’ve worked to bridge the gap between these children and the world of advertising and digital- training them, mentoring them, and preparing them to become skilled professionals who can one day contribute meaningfully to our industry and to the economy.
This journey wouldn’t have been possible without our partners. We are deeply grateful to the @govardhanruraldevelopment, @enrichlivesfoundation, @hasbroindia, @tuesdayscorp , @simpolotilesandbathware Foundation, and many others who have stood by us with shared purpose and vision.
Together, we have the power to shape a child’s future, strengthen our economy, and elevate our industry.
Let’s continue to come together for the greater good.

Comment “Marketing” to get the episode link in your DMs.
In this episode, I sit down with Harshil Karia, founder of Schbang, to break down what it really takes to lead in modern marketing. 
From a campaign that nailed cultural relevance to one that sparked controversy, we unpack the wins, the lessons, and everything in between.
We also talk about red-flag clients, what makes someone irreplaceable, and why running an agency today is about more than just execution, it’s about mindset, culture, and clarity.

Awesome @schbang Unwind this morning walking through the streets of Fort led by the awesome @riddhijoshi2210 telling us all about the early history of our city including the fact that our city was a dowry gift, that historically it’s the Borivali and Andheri areas that were the Center of the city, that the Fort area was actually a ‘Fort’ and the wall of that fort came down by the industrialist and philanthropist that built the JJ School of art and hospital. So many interesting nuggets and such a refreshing morning! Thanks @mananvaswani2003 @anaghaj46 Riddhi P for organising 🌟

Everyone loves a good idea.
But few stick around for the hundred bad ones that came before it.

Behind every successful campaign is a wall like this, cluttered with iterations, experiments, late nights, and “almost-there” moments.

Creativity isn’t magic. It's a process.
And that process needs room to fail, observe, rework… and then finally, spark.

If you're building a creative culture, don’t just chase inspiration.
Design systems that catch it when it shows up.

A big thanks to Suketu Gohel, Head of Art at Schbang, it was his idea to build this creative wall in our office.

“The answer to most problems is—Growth.” #GoodAdsMatterRoundtable

Harshil Karia @harshiljkaria, founder of Schbang @schbang, couldn’t have put it better. At the Good Ads Matter Roundtable, he revealed his ambition to build a 100,000-strong company before he retires—because in his view, growth isn’t just about scale, it’s about impact.

With young minds in India more culturally attuned than ever, he believes the country is poised to become the global hub for creative and martech services. Having scouted expansion sites across the world, he’s got his sights set far beyond borders—so much so that Sonal amusedly dubs him “Founder’s Allrounder.” 

Big vision, bold moves—do you think India is ready to take center stage? Tell us in the comments!

Over the past 18 months, Akshay had gradually stepped back from the day-to-day operations, making this a natural and thoughtful transition while making way for a very strong and capable expanded leadership team. His shares have now been acquired by Harshil Karia and Sohil Karia, marking an important milestone in our journey.

We’re incredibly grateful for his contributions—from the early days of dreaming to the reality of what Schbang is today. Wishing him nothing but the best for what comes next!

At Schbang, we continue to grow, evolve, and strengthen our foundation. In the last 18 months, we’ve expanded in big ways—acquiring AddiktSchbang to deepen our EU presence, acqui-hiring @uncodez to level up our WhatsApp marketing capabilities, and welcoming over 75 new businesses.

Today, Schbang’s Partner Network spans 8 agencies across India, enabling us to offer clients a fully integrated suite of services. With a strong management team of 50+ leaders and a powerhouse of 1,200+ Schbangers, we’re stepping into the future with momentum, ambition, and an unshakable belief in what’s next.

A heartfelt thank you to our mentors, partners, and well-wishers who made this transition seamless. Onwards and upwards!

🇮🇳 To The 🌍

Being a founder means juggling a million things at once—but despite the chaos, I’ve learned how to stay calm and focused. 💪

How? @levelsupermind has been a game changer for me. I’ve learned to prioritize my mental health and find balance through simple practices that work:

-Mindful Breathing: A few deep breaths go a long way in clearing my head.
-Daily Meditation: Helps me center myself and stay grounded when everything feels like a whirlwind.
-Visualization: Keeps me focused on my goals, not the noise around me.
-Consistency: Small, daily habits have made all the difference in my mindset.

I won’t lie, it’s a journey. But taking care of your mind is just as important as building a business. If I can do it, so can you. ✨

Running an agency is no joke, and some clients can make it even harder. In this episode of Aleena Dissects, I asked Harshil about the red flags to watch out for in a client. Here’s what he shared:

- Marketing isn’t treated as a priority

- There’s no real budget allocated for it

- It’s not tied to their overall business strategy

- The margins are too thin to justify the work

- There’s no room for creative input, just plain execution

These are signs that the partnership might not be worth it.
Watch the full episode to hear more insights and agency truths, on Aleena Dissects.

In my opinion,
- Prompts will write ads & shoots .. for Reels this is the way imagination can run wild
- Mid-tier production is dead
- Everyone will elevate craft
- Influencers will license their faces inside prompts
- In the short run, good editors will have a higher premium

*Noones really getting irrelevant. Unless there's a refusal to evolve.
